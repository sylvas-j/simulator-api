"Mr. Solomon Sauls ran an illegal enterprise with the purpose of poaching and selling abalone (Haliotis midae) in South Africa. A group of abalone divers worked under him supplying him with illegally harvested abalone. The accused bribed officials from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to prevent them from confiscating abalone and to buy back abalone already seized by the authorities. The corrupt officials are facing charges in a separate trial.In March 2018, the police searched the accused’s house and encountered cash that the accused confessed to proceeds of his illegal activities. In February 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to 41 counts involving running an illegal enterprise, corruption, money laundering and possessing and transporting illegally harvested abalone.Factors aggravating the sentence were the seriousness of corrupting government officials, the engagement in the illegal abalone trade on a commercial scale and financial greed.The accused has been involved in similar crimes in the past and previously received prison sentences for his involvement with another illegal enterprise focusing on abalone poaching.In 2019, he was found responsible for running an illegal abalone business in a different area and was handed a 14-year sentence.In the current trial, Solomon Sauls was sentenced to 244 years imprisonment, running concurrently and resulting in an effective 18-year sentence. Of those 18 years, 12 were determined to run concurrently to the previous sentence of 14 years.",money laundry,1
"SummaryHarmony Gold Mine (Pty) Limited is a mining company operating the Masimong Gold Mine in the district of Henneman in South Africa. Miners can legally enter the shafts if they are able to produce a mining identity card used to clock-in and out when entering and exiting the mine. Notwithstanding, it was common knowledge that the clocking system could be breached allowing illegal miners to enter the mine. Illegal mining operations inside the mine were a known phenomenon and illegal processing or refinery plants were found and subsequently destroyed in the past.From 10-11 April 2014, an underground “clean-up” operation to expose illegal miners was carried out by a security agency. During the operation, makeshift gold processing plants, beds, letters, books, name lists and other documents were discovered, together with large quantities of extracted ore. The documents included gold transaction notes and photographs, pointing towards the identities of the illegal miners.The investigation brought to light that ore worth ZAR 125 million were extracted using processing plants. Yet, on site, investigators only discovered material worth ZAR 41 million (1211 tons of ore) that were moved and made ready for further transports using canvas bags.Though no one was arrested during the two-day operations, 22 people were found and arrested between 16 April and 14 July 2014, mostly while being on the mine’s premises. One person was arrested outside the premises, incriminated by document evidence encountered on site.The group of arrested consisted of nationals from Mozambique and Zimbabwe between 20 and 43 years old and were found to have a varying degree of involvement in the illegal enterprise. Lovemore Chaba Mlambo was identified as orchestrating the illegal operations.They were found guilty of racketeering, money laundering, as well as contravention of the Precious Metals Act and the Criminal Procedure Act. On 14 March 2017, the Virginia Circuit Court sentenced them to prison sentences ranging from 3 to 20 years.They appealed the judgment in front of the High Court of South Africa, Free State Division (Bloemfontein) but saw their appeal rejected on 22 March 2019.Details on the appealThe appellants argued that they had not been caught conducting any illegal mining operations. The respondent countered that the essential ingredient for the criminal racketeering activity is the conspiracy to commit an organized criminal offence or to participate in an unlawful enterprise. Hence, the appellants could be prosecuted on racketeering charges even though they were not caught red-handed. The court found that an implicit agreement among the appellants was manifested in the construction of the illegal refinery plants and the fact that ore had been extracted already, which in itself is a laborious effort requiring collaboration. Furthermore, the names of some illegal miners were found in documentation seized on site. Following a similar line of argumentation, the court rejected the challenge of an established common purpose and enterprise-like organization of the appellants.Moreover, the appellants argued that while ore valued up to ZAR 125 million were extracted, only ZAR 41 million (1211 tons) worth of ore were found on site, implying that the lion share of gold could still be somewhere in the mine. Therefore, the mine operator would not have lost that ore. The court denied this argument of appeal based on the fact that the ore encountered had already been extracted and prepared for future transport which, in turn, showed that the group was capable of removing extracted ore from the mining premises. Furthermore, the court argued that the extracted but not encountered ore would amount to a quantity of 2481 tons, making it significant enough to not be overlooked and hence, unlikely to still reside within the premises of the mine. Paperwork seized on the illegal mining site further documented that extracted ore had previously been sold to an outside buyer.Also, the appellants argued that the identity of the perpetrators was not reasonably established beyond doubt.  This is because none of the appellants was found either near the shaft nor mining nor being in possession of gold ore. The respondent argued that the appellants were arrested by staff of the mine security at the surface as they stepped out of the elevator leading down to the mine. None of them was able to identify themselves with a valid mine identity card, yet many of them were in possession of mining equipment such as safety heads, protectors and cap lamps. Hence, the court found it unlikely that any of the arrested coming out of the shaft had any other business in mind than participating in the ongoing illegal mining operation.Consequently, the appeal was rejected.",money laundry,1
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",money laundry,1
"Johannes Erasmus van Staden was a Cape Town businessman and registered representative vendor of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, Indo Atlantic Shipping limited and Southern Ocean Marine Corporation (Pty) Limited. From 2005 to 2008, he engaged in an illegal scheme through which he defrauded the South African Revenue Service (SARS). His modus operandi included falsely presenting invoices and inflated fish export records to the SARS, which in return refunded VAT to Mr. van Staden’s company. Over the course of time, Mr. van Staden defrauded taxes of more than R250 million. In June 2016, he was found guilt on 43 charges of racketeering, fraud, reckless conduct of business, and contravention of the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, such as money laundering. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.During 2005 and 2008, Mr. van Staden submitted false records about alleged fish exports to the SARS, indicating much higher amounts of fish exports than accurate. Furthermore, he submitted alleged expenditures of his business, such as expenditures for refrigerator systems, delivery trucks, and fish production lines. He obtained authentic invoices for these expenditures by requesting quotes from different providers in the fisheries industry. He repeatedly accepted offers and asked for invoices, which he claimed were for financial purposes. Upon reception of these invoices, he submitted them to the SARS but walked away from the deals. Through this, Mr. van Staden not only defrauded money from the SARS but also inflicted significant economic damage on third-party service providers.In early 2005, Mr. van Staden approached S&D Consulting to function as bookkeeper and accountant to the Indo Atlantic group on a commission basis. Later that year, the First National Bank closed the account of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, upon which S&D Consulting started to receive their financial transactions instead. After deducting their commission and fee, SD Consulting forwarded the money to Indo Atlantic companies. Mr. van Staden lived a lavish lifestyle with that money, funnelling it through a family trust called Swordfish Trust. Through this, he financed his luxury expenses, including the purchase of a game farm, an airplane, different motor vehicles, an apartment for his daughter, and a family vacation with chartered jet.The initial indictment was directed at Mr. van Staden and five other potential perpetrators. In June 2016, Mr. van Staden was found guilty on 43 out of 184 counts, whereas the other accused were found not guilty on all charges. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.",money laundry,1
"Juan Hattingh was a young practicing attorney and conveyancer with a portfolio of high profile clients that included four important South African banks, namely, ABSA, Standard Bank, First National Bank, and Nedbank. Apart from his firm, Hattingh Attorneys, of which he was the sole proprietor, he also held interests in other local firms of attorneys. As his practice flourished, he ventured into other enterprises such as property development and construction. In 2011, he pleaded guilty to a sophisticated scheme of fraud, theft, and money laundering in which he utilized his professional attorney’s trust account for criminal purposes. The scheme included the registration of properties acquired by Hattingh under the names of friends and relatives, double-bonded properties, and the use of his trust account as a deposit for the stolen funds. “In other words, he had operated his trust account as a vehicle through which to launder the proceeds of his unlawful activities.” (Hamman & Koen, 2012). Hattingh was convicted of 64 counts of fraud, one count of theft and one count of money laundering. He received an effective term of 20 years' imprisonment for the charges of fraud and theft, and a suspended sentence of 8 years' imprisonment for the charge of money laundering. Additionally, the Law Society successfully applied to have his name struck off the roll of practicing attorneys.On appeal against the sentences imposed on him in respect of the fraud charges, he contended that the trial court had sentenced him beyond the scope of his guilty plea and had overlooked mitigating factors. The Supreme Court of Appeal agreed with him and reduced his sentence to 12 years' imprisonment for the charge of fraud.",money laundry,1
"In November 2010, under the authority of the South African National Director of Public Prosecution, Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited entered into an agreement whereby it pleaded guilty to 102 counts related to charges stemming from having allowed its ‘employees and facilities to be used to conduct … illegal kidney transplant operations’. In addition to Netcare, a number of other charges were laid against the St Augustine's Hospital, located in Durban, South Africa, the CEO of Netcare, Richard Friedland, and eight others: four transplant doctors, a nephrologist, two transplant administrative coordinators, and an interpreter. The admission of guilt related to 109 illegal kidney transplant operations that took place between June 2001 and November 2003. The scheme involved Israeli citizens in need of kidney transplants who would be brought to South Africa for transplants performed at St Augustine's Hospital.While the kidneys supplied originally came from Israeli citizens, ‘later Romanian and Brazilian citizens were recruited as their kidneys were obtainable at a much lower cost’. The broker, Ilan Perry, was the individual who was in charge of the recruitment of both kidney suppliers and recipients and was not South African and has not been charged. He set a fee of between USD 100,000 and USD 120,000 for recipients and paid the original suppliers of kidneys USD 20,000. However, later on in the scheme, Romanians and Brazilians received on average of USD 6,000.Ilan Perry used recruiters to source individuals ready to supply kidneys; two of these, Captain Ivan Da Silva and Gaby Tauber, had been imprisoned in Brazil for their roles in the affair. Blood screening of prospective kidney suppliers was done in-country and again in South Africa in an attempt to ‘ensure sufficient compatibility with prospective recipients’; those deemed suitable were ‘accommodated and chaperoned’ and ‘given documents to sign falsely indicating that they were related to each other’. This fraudulent activity was meant to circumvent the requirement to gain outside approval, via a Ministerial Committee, for transplants of unrelated principals. While Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited was paid up-front for its participation in the illegal kidney transplants, the people supplying the healthy kidneys were paid after the fact and in cash.The charges to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty were laid under the South African Human Tissue Act 1983 and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. It might be mentioned that the company escaped charges which had been leveled at the other accused, including fraud, forgery, and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm (for operations without informed consent). The Human Tissue Act 1983 prohibited the transplantation of the tissue of minors into another living person; requiring that written consent be provided; and that no purchase of tissue, such as kidneys, was allowed. Further, there existed a Ministerial Policy of the Department of Health which set out, inter alia, that:“Donor organs must be used primarily for South African citizens and permanent residents. Written consent must be obtained from the Minister of Health before any person who is not a South African citizen or permanent resident is accepted onto a transplantation programme.”The Ministerial policy also established that a Ministerial Committee had to approve applications for transplantation of unrelated living donors so as ‘to reduce the possibility of abuse’.The prosecutor later argued that the company and the other accused must have been aware of the law and policy regarding transplants from living donors, and that they had to try to find a way to portray ostensible compliance with the current policy and legislation. They therefore created the pretence that the kidney suppliers were related to the recipients.The first charge--counts 1 to 5--to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty related to the use of five minors as organ suppliers in violation of the Human Tissue Act 1983. The employees of St Augustine's Hospital were recognised, in the convoluted Charge Sheet of the Prosecutor, to be ‘acting on behalf of the accused company and were about the exercised of their powers and the performance of their duties as employees of the company furthering or endeavouring to further the interests of the company’, in carrying out these illegal kidney transplants. Counts 6 to 10 constituted the second charge and related to receiving payment for the kidney transplants emanating from the five minors. It might be mentioned that Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited received payments from the broker and it then disbursed payment ‘to the other accused and service providers; including the surgeons for their services’. The third charge, consisting of counts 11 through 102, related to contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. In regard to the 102 transplant operations that did not include minors, the company pleaded guilty to its employees having received money, the proceeds of an unlawful activity; while Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited admitted that ‘in the circumstances’, it knew ‘that the aforementioned property formed part of the proceeds of unlawful activities’.In the Agreement between Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited and the State, the State recognised its own legitimate interest ‘in overseeing the control over transplant of human tissues […] the interests of the medical profession and the public at large’. Where the public interest was concerned, the Agreement noted:“that a company, such as the accused company, guilty of an offence such as this, should be convicted and punished and more particularly, that that conviction and punishment should take place in open court for society as a whole to come to know and understand that the prosecuting authorities and the Department of Health will not tolerate breaches of the code of conduct and standards of ethics and compliance with the law required in a civilised society.”The Agreement then set out the penalty imposed: a confiscation order of ZAR 3,800,000 (approximately USD 466,839) amounting to the benefit the company derived from the offences, plus a sentence of ZAR 4,020,000 (approximately USD 493,875) amounting to fines for each of the counts to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty.",other crimes,0
"The organized criminal group is highly organised and operates transnationally. They are commonly known in South Africa as the “Mountain Boys”.The syndicate engaged in a range of criminal activities that constitute serious offences under South African law. The offences relate to racketeering activities and related categories of offences including money-laundering offences. The information gathered further indicates that in addition thereto these entities and persons have through their criminal activities committed a range of further serious offences including theft, fraud as well as offences under the provisions of the South African Mining Rights Act as well as the Precious Metals Act. There are five clearly distinguishable levels of activities used by the syndicate to smuggle unwrought precious metals (PGMs). This is illustrated as follows:As a starting point, PGMs are stolen at source from the mines, often in large quantities. These PGMs are eventually sold through various receivers to exporters.The various levels of the criminal operators in the illicit PGM industry can be explained as follows:Level 1 “the runners”The unwrought PGM’s are stolen from the processing plants in South African Mines and is commonly referred to as “theft at the source”. A runner, who is mostly an employee of the mine, will then transport the material from the mine by bag or by other methods and sell it to a middleman. Runners tend to have a wide network of black market contacts, including illicit smelters.Level 2 “the middleman”The middleman buys considerable volumes of PGMs from the runners. The middleman crushes the PGMs into smaller pieces and packages it for the national buyers, before delivery.Level 3 “national buyers”The national buyers are mostly based in the RSA and they buy the PGM’S from the level 1 and 2’s. These buyers appear to be the link between the runners and more sophisticated syndicates who constitute the next level in the hierarchy of the criminal operators. These buyers are often the agents of the more sophisticated syndicate or they operate as independent couriers for such syndicates. Their task is to buy and transport the material from the middleman to wealthy local syndicate leaders.Level 4 “the local syndicate leader”The syndicate leader / buyer use a fronting company, usually a Scrap Metal dealer to export the product from the RSA. The PGM stocks that they have purchased from various sources are processed, containerised or packaged and then sold to local or international contacts. Processing allows for detailed records to be kept by the syndicate leaders from whom the product is bought and samples are also takenfor analysis (assay) to determine value and PGM content. Storage bags/drums are weighed, marked and sealed. Smaller high value PGM parcels are exported using a courier network and bulk tonnage of PGM is containerised and either flown or shipped from the RSA. Misrepresentations are made to customs by undervaluing and falsifying the nature of the consignment. This then successfully overcomes the requirements for prescribed permits and licences to possess transport and deal in the product as required by the Act.Level 5 “the international buyers”The international contacts are situated abroad. The international market for unwrought PGM’s appears to be more attractive than the South African market as it is unregulated. Sophisticated networks, consisting of legal persons and entities register to deal in PGMs have been established abroad to deal with the imports and proceeds derived from the sale after being sold to the refiners in Western Europe, United Kingdom and Canada, capable of refining the product for commercial use. It appears that the ultimate destination is inevitably a buyer abroad rather than someone in South Africa.Note: The current syndicate under discussion were classified as level 3 to 5 operators.Legal entities involved in the case:1. Group members and others employed by or associated with the group, procured unwrought precious metals (PGMs), comprising platinum in the main from mines in South Africa, especially the Rustenburg area, where after samples thereof would be assayed by legal entities and/or persons to determine content and value, where after it would be exported to Just Refiners and Technology, UK or to a company styled as an international freight forwarding company, based in Felixstowe, Suffolk, United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere.2. Before being dispatched by front companies especially used as part of the concealment of the illicit PGMs, the PGMs would be stored and packed into containers for export purposes in various warehouses in and around Johannesburg. If of large quantity it would then be shipped from Durban and if of smaller quantity from Johannesburg airport.3. Before being shipped, documentation for export purposes containing false information regarding content, value and/or exporter would be prepared and presented to the authorities.4. With reference to certain of the charges, Boekhoud would cause the unwrought precious metals to be assayed upon receipt in the United Kingdom at a company based in Sheffield, United Kingdom, and then upon receipt of the correct values of the product prepare or cause to be prepared so – called self – billing invoices and inform the exporters of the true value and content. Boekhoud, would then, having been provided with banking details by V Naidoo or Hoosan, remit the proceeds of sales to accounts as directed.When acting as they did the accused acted with a common purpose to commit the offences charged with.5. The Accused and others were a group of individuals associated in fact with one another for purposes of obtaining monetary benefits by means of engaging in illegal procurement and smuggling of unwrought precious metals, and, as such, their association in fact constituted an enterprise as defined in section 1(1) (v) of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, 121 of 1998.6. V Naidoo was the leader of the group. He was actively involved in the procurement and dispatch phases of unwrought precious metals and directing where proceeds from sales were to be remitted to.7. Boekhoud was a director and shareholder of a company styled Just Refiners & Technology Ltd, based in Ramsey, Huntingdon in the United Kingdom (“JRT, UK”). JRT, UK received, refined and disposed of the unwrought precious metals at a profit on behalf of the group. Boekhoud was a member of or associated with the group until the end of 2001.8. R Naidoo, a younger brother of V Naidoo, assisted in the procurement of unwrought precious metals and in storing such before being exported to the United Kingdom, Canada or elsewhere.9. R Moonian assisted in the procurement and storing of unwrought precious metals before disposal.10. Longhow collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the enterprise during the period 2000 to 2001, where after he left the group with Kevin Naidoo (the younger brother of V Naidoo and R Naidoo) and formed a new group involved in the same activities.11. Y Chetty collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group.12. Hoosan procured unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group. He also, on occasion, directly or indirectly, informed accused 1 as to where the proceeds of sales of unwrought precious metals were to be remitted into international bank accounts and also assisted the syndicate to trade with the proceeds of crime in exchange for South African currency (using a havala type informal banking scheme)13. James procured PGMs and was the accountant for his brother in law, Boekhoud and JRT.14. There were also other individuals employed by or associated with the group from time to time, who assisted in the procurement, transportation or disposal of unwrought precious metals.",other crimes,0
"OverviewIn June 2016, inside the Makana Resort in Grahamstown South Africa, three men were arrested by the South African Police Service (SAPS) as part of a wider police operation called Full Moon. The three accused were caught red-handed, carrying a freshly removed 10.7kg rhino horn, a tranquilizer dart gun including darts and tranquilizers, a bow saw, ammunition, knives, side cutters, a cordless drill, and several phones and sim cards.The investigation of the case could link the accused to 13 separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching which took place between 2013 and 2016. In April 2019, all three accused were found guilty on 50 counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison each.DetailsIn June 2016 the white rhino Cambell was killed and his horn was taken at a farm in the district of Albany, South Africa. A post-mortem examination into the death of Cambell was initiated. The bull was lying in a large pool of blood with blood tainted foam located on its right side with the front horn missing. The sinuses and airways were exposed when the horn was removed, which was done using a sharp serrated blade. From the injuries it became apparent that the rhino was still alive during the procedure. Furthermore, the examination concluded that in the absence of a bullet entry into the rhino’s body, it had been immobilized by the use of a highly potent drug. The death of the animal was caused by the damage to tissues and blood vessels, the resulting blood loss along with the amount of pain.As part of the operation Full Moon, an operation named after the fact that many rhino killings take place during periods of full moon, the South African Police Service (SAPS) arrested three men in the night of 17 June 2016. The three accused Jabulani John Ndlovu (accused 1), Forget Ndlovu (accused 2) and Sibusiso Sani Ndlovu (accused 3) were arrested in Grahamstown, South Africa. At the time of their arrest, several items used for rhino poaching operations were found in their chalet, including a freshly removed rhino horn and a saw (see full list below).Further investigations found that the freshly harvested horn belonged to the white rhino Cambell. DNA material of the horn was also found on the saw seized during the arrest. During the course of the investigation, the poaching of Cambell was linked to nine other rhino killings which took place between 2013 and 2016 in several districts in South Africa. The post-mortem examinations of all crime scenes concluded the same modus operandi had been used for the killing and harvesting of the rhinos and their horns. In particular, the modus operandi encompassed: the incidents took place during the period of the full moon; tracks of two persons were found at each crime scene; dart guns and a specific dart (Pnew dart) were used; all rhinos were tranquilized using Etorphine and/or Thiafentanil; and the horns were removed in a specific manner with a saw. In some instances, the rhinos were heavily pregnant, in which cases the sub-adults’ horns had been removed in the same way as their mothers’. Moreover, cell phone data of the accused phones showed that the phones were used in timely and spatial proximity to the previous poaching incidents.The accused were charged with ten separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching, including 50 counts related to these. In March 2019, the accused were found guilty on ten counts of theft; ten counts of carrying out a restricted activity involving a specimen of a protected species without a permit; ten counts of illegal hunting; ten counts of the possession of a scheduled substance; ten counts of unlawful possession of ammunition. Furthermore, 15 other counts on three separate poaching incidents that were initially on the charge sheet were separated and bound for another trial.One month later, on 3 April 2019, the High Court of South Africa sentenced each of the accused to 25 years imprisonment.",trafficking in firearms,0
"According to her statements, V1 was probably 26 years old when her exposure to drugs began. In her childhood, she was molested by someone close to her family. This had a great impact on her life as an adult person. She felt unloved and dirty. To cope she took her mother’s prescription medicine, anti-depressants and sleeping tablets. Her first marriage was abusive, and she divorced her husband whilst expecting her first child. By this time, she was a full corporal working as a chef at the air force base. She turned to alcohol and stated that she was becoming an alcoholic. Her friendship with a certain sergeant, a male work colleague lead to her introduction to the sordid world of hard drugs. The sergeant took her to a Nigerian dealer in Sunnyside, Pretoria. He taught her how the drug, which she came to know as ‘rocks’ was smoked using a glass pipe. She enjoyed the experience of drug-induced happiness and over time, her cravings grew. From once a month to once a week, they made more frequent trips to Sunnyside to obtain drugs. Eventually she found herself smoking drugs every other day. Her salary of R4700.00 could not fund her addiction and she borrowed money and began selling her household goods. The sergeant suggested that if she agreed to have sex with the dealer they would get a free supply of drugs. This exchange of sex for drugs extended to other Nigerian dealers as well. Eventually she began going out on her own to obtain drugs.It was during one such outing that she was taken in by a certain Nigerian dealer when she found herself stranded at night as her motor bike needed repairs. Under the guise of offering to help her, she was taken to his flat and given more drugs. From then onwards she never returned home permanently. Because she was absent without leave, she lost her job. She went on to recount a detailed train of events, which eventually resulted in her being taken in by the accused. The details are omitted only to the extent that bear light on her transformation from drug addict to becoming a fully-fledged sex slave. The person who assisted her with her motor bike had other girls living in his flat. She was given clothes and taught how to work the streets as a prostitute. Her every movement was monitored and all income she made was taken from her. Depending on how much money she made she received rocks in exchange.She was sold to another Nigerian dealer known as Omeka who took her off the streets and advertised her body on the internet. She was photographed, and advertisements were placed offering her sexual services. She stayed here for several months and made a lot of money for the dealer.  When she managed to return to Sunnyside she met a Nigerian who she referred to as ‘Uncle’. He supplied her with rocks in exchange for her working for him as a prostitute. She thereafter was passed on and worked for another Nigerian called John during which time she realised she was pregnant. She was not allowed to leave the house and did not have many clients. Because she was not making any money John sold her to the accused.She occupied the accused’s 2-bedroom flat with a Coloured woman and a Nigerian man. She shared one room with the accused and the other couple the other. She had sexual intercourse with the accused to obtain drugs. The pattern of her lifestyle was the same – her body was advertised in provocative poses on the internet after being photographed in skimpy underwear. Men would make appointments for sex after viewing the site. Advertisements were placed on sites such as Sex Trader, Escort South Africa and Red Velvet. She had no choice in the matter. The men would call at the flat where the sexual encounters took place. Her other chores included cleaning the flat and making food. Initially she remained locked in with the Nigerian keeping guard over them. The accused collected her earnings in the evenings when he returned. In exchange, he gave her rocks for half the value of the money earned. She was unable to say whether he had any other source of income. The accused became angry if she did not see clients and bring in money. She saw 4 to 5 clients a day at a rate of R400.00 for half an hour and R500.00 for an hour. Her sole motivation to see clients was to make money for the accused to obtain drugs and sustain her addiction. Her morning drug doze, which she called the ‘wake up’ drug, was provided free by the accused and so was the evening drug, which she referred to as the ‘sleeper’.She believed that the accused was her pimp. All money earned was collected by the accused who gave her drugs in exchange. She stated that the accused used her earnings to pay the rent, buy food, toiletries and clothes for her, as she had to look good for the clients. The accused kept the rest of the money for himself.  There was a time on her birthday that the accused took her to a shopping centre to see her parents for about 15 minutes whilst keeping her under observation all the time. She did not disclose that she was being kept against her will by the accused. They lived in Faerie Glen at that time. Because she was given a cell phone so that clients could contact her, she was able to contact the Welfare regarding the birth of her child. In the accused’s absence, she left to stay at this welfare home for a week where her child was born. She stated that for a while she overcame the cravings to take any drugs, as having the child was more important to her. She decided against putting the child up for adoption and returned to live with her parents. She was even able to find work as a receptionist for a month or two. However, her addiction overcame her and on a trip one evening to buy drugs, the accused traced her and forcefully took her to Silverton. She began living there with the accused and a certain KC, who was also Nigerian. The accused again arranged for her to see clients after she was advertised on the sex website. KC manufactured drugs in the kitchen and sold it to the accused. She estimated that she made approximately R40 000.0 a month and all of this went to the accused. Her movements were severely restricted, and she was effectively locked up in the building. The accused threatened to kill her if she tried to run away again. Thereafter they moved to a flat in Silversands.V1 narrated an incident about an assault when the accused followed her to a flat where she was severely beaten. He hit her using his fists and open hands, kicked her on her ribs, beat her with a dog chain and stick all over her body. She was no longer on speaking terms with her parents who blamed her for leaving her children. In her loneliness, she explained that she turned to making the accused’s life happy so that her life could be happy. There were many instances when he assaulted her and punished her by not giving her drugs. He manipulated her emotionally and made her believe that she was worthless. When they moved to Loskop Street, she was able to escape in the boot of the car of the client of another girl. She returned to her parent’s home and stayed there for a long time. Her third daughter was born during this time. She reverted to using drugs again. The accused came across her one evening when she went to buy drugs and took her back with him. She had earlier incurred a drug debt with a certain Nigerian dealer called JJ who held her motor bike as security for payment. The accused made this payment of R2000.00 on her behalf after she was escorted by force to his car. The arrangements were that she would live with a certain Chooks for a while and that her bike would be collected later.During her stay with Chooks, she reverted to prostitution through the internet and received her daily supply of drugs. Chooks became her new pimp for a while, although she later found out that the money was shared with the accused. The accused got to know that Chooks made a lot of money from the clients which she picked up from a local bar and took her away to live in Elarduspark, which was the home of a certain Cheedi, a person the accused worked for when he arrived in South Africa. They rented a room there. There were other prostitutes in the house. Because the accused failed to pay the rent, they left to live in a flat in Sunnyside. A certain Charles owned this flat and 4 or 5 other prostitutes occupied it. The ladies worked the streets for clients. The accused kept guard over V1, who worked on the internet and the streets.Eventually, they moved to Sandalwood Road, Newlands. She and the accused occupied the bottom level. This was the address where the accused was arrested. This was also the address where the 2nd complainant V2 came to live a few months later. V2 was an 18-year-old drug addict recruited by Chooks for which he also got a share of her earnings as a prostitute. She believed that the accused had sex with V2 the evening she arrived because she came across a condom.  She had no knowledge of any rape. The accused continued to make more money with two girls working. They saw more clients here and made more money all of which the accused controlled. The girls were advertised in newspapers and the internet. All sexual activities took place in exchange for drugs supplied by the accused at this venue rented by the accused. When the clients called at the premises, the accused would lurk in the background so that he was not seen but he always was informed what was going on. The witness was shown a bundle of cell phone records, but she was unable to confirm that any of the names appearing therein were used by her or related to her.She contacted her parents through Facebook and arranged to go to the Children’s Court in Pretoria North to sign off her last born so that her parents would become legal guardians of her child. It was before magistrate Hitchcock that she made a full disclosure which caused the magistrate to report the matter to the Hawks. V1 accompanied the officers to point out the premises where the accused was arrested. She was thereafter in protective custody.Under cross examination she denied that the accused was the father of her second born child. She conceded that the only reason she continued to stay on with the drug dealers was because of her drug addiction and she believed that she was acting out of her own free will at the time. She denied that her working as a prostitute was due to an arrangement she had with the accused. It was put to her that she was not forced to see clients and she only did so get money for her addiction. She denied this. She clarified that her wake up and sleeper drugs were given to her by the accused free of charge. However, if she did not see clients she was not given food, and something was taken away from her as punishment. She further conceded that although opportunities presented itself for her to run away from the accused, the accused made threats to kill her family if she ever tried to run away and he had her motor cycle.There was a time when her father reported her missing to the police. She was questioned about a police raid, which took place whilst living in Elarduspark, which created an opportunity for her to make a report to the police. She affirmed that she did so, but they returned her to the accused. This made her lose all faith and hope in their ability to help her. The accused maintained that after she left, it was she who contacted him to settle her debts, which he did to stop her working on the streets. She denied this and maintained that it created a further obligation to advertise her on the internet and force her to offer her sexual services over a long time.Statements of V2According to her statements, V2 was 6 months old when she, together with her sisters and brother were placed in the welfare social system. This happened after she was raped by her father. Her mother became a prostitute. She was then moved to another home, which separated her from her siblings. From there she was placed in the Morester Children’s Home until she was 12 years old.  She was thereafter transferred to the Catherine Robinson Children’s Home in Vereeniging. Here she was subjected to bullying and mockery which resulted in her getting into fights with other learners. At the Home she associated with a group of girls she described as ‘wrong friends’. One in the group introduced the rest to start smoking dagga. They absconded from school for 3 months to live with a certain Aunty Baby who owned a pub. Their intention was to go on a drinking spree. She made acquaintances at the pub during this time that paid for the drinks. The police located them, and they returned to the school. She was then introduced to mandrax and ended up using drugs. A Nigerian man abducted her from school and took her to an unknown location where she was kept. She stated that they forced her to smoke drugs after being assaulted.V2 described a certain Charles as one of the Nigerians from Vereeniging who sold girls. She regarded him as her boss who was nice and believed at the time she was in love with him. Charles sold her to a person called Austin. He became her boss and she was attracted to him. According to her evidence she also fell in love with Austin and had a sexual relationship with him. She began working as a prostitute for Austin under threat that her family will be harmed. She was sold back to Charles after Austin made a girl pregnant. Both Austin and Charles had drug dealings. Thereafter Charles sold her for R5000.00 to a person called Allaji. She described Allaji as one of the big bosses from Nigeria. His street name was Kenneth. She was taken to his flat at an unknown location and put to work as a prostitute. He already had 5 girls working as prostitutes. All of them were beaten up. He had a hold over her because of the drugs he supplied to her and expected her to pay him back from her earnings as a prostitute. She was also given a ‘wake up’ drug in the morning, in the afternoon and a ‘sleeper’ doze at night. Her addiction to crystal meth led to severe cravings.    Initially she worked on the streets and was then photographed and advertised on the internet offering sexual services. She was 16 at that stage. The clients would call her directly and make a booking. After they paid her, the money was handed to Allaji. After 5 years she managed to escape. After staying a week with her aunt, she arranged to meet a certain person called Moody whom she earlier knew. She arranged to meet him in Johannesburg but encountered a certain person called Chooks instead. Chooks, who was also Nigerian showed an interest in her and offered that she stays with him. He brought her to Pretoria and that is how she met the accused and the first complainant V1. They were living in a one room flat with a bathroom. Chooks left her there and returned to Johannesburg. It was V1 who told her that Chooks had sold her to the accused. She smoked rocks with V1. Because V1 had to see a client, she waited with the accused in another outside room. The accused told her that he loved her and wished to sleep with her. She refused. The accused again made sexual advances towards her which she again refused. He then forced himself on her, removed her clothes, put on a condom and had sexual intercourse with her against her will. She stated that at this moment, she ‘switched off’ which was understood to mean that she did not resist and she said because she felt nobody cared. She had an experience of being raped as a 13-year-old at gun point. She did not seek help from V1 because she sensed that V1 was as afraid of the accused as she was. Even the next morning, although V1 came across the condom in the bin, she did not disclose that she was raped, as she feared for her life. The accused arranged for Estcourt South Africa to photograph her. Pictures were taken of her in her underwear posing in different provocative positions. The pictures were paid for by the accused and she received many clients in response to the advertisement.The accused fixed her service rate at R400.00 for half an hour and R800.00 for an hour’s sex. The money earned was handed to the accused. She was given a cell phone to make the bookings. She did not contact her Aunt because she did not have her number. She was too scared to run away from the accused. She recalled how she was beaten by Allaji.She also narrated the events relating to further incident when the accused raped her. This happened during the evening shortly before the accused was arrested for the present case. She had earlier seen a client and called the accused to give him the money. He came by 6pm and wanted to have sex with her. She refused. He then forced himself on her and had sexual intercourse with her in the same manner as he did before. In exchange for the money she earned he gave her a ‘sleeper’ drug. She stated that it had been part of the rules she knew living with the Nigerians that all the money was given to them or you would be beaten up. The accused also threatened to assault her, and she feared that if she refused to work for him, her life would be in danger. Food in the house was scarce and sometimes she ate once a day.She was not allowed to go anywhere, and clients contacted her by cell phone. The language she used in court when describing the accused showed an intense hatred she bore for what he put her through. When asked if she though V1 feared the accused, her answer was a ‘deadly yes’. Apart from seeing clients, she also had to clean the house. The three weeks she lived there, she saw up to 5 clients a day. At times, she made up to R4000.00 a day for the accused.She was wearing a very revealing outfit before the police arrived. The accused bought that outfit because he wanted her to look sexy for clients. When the police knocked on the door, she hid the glass pipe and the drug pieces, were flushed down the toilet. She was high on drugs at the time and had consumed alcohol. Warrant officer Qegu took her to the bathroom where she showed her what she had hidden. She was hysterical at this stage. The officer asked her to pack her things and covered with a blanket. When they got to the car, she saw V1 hiding in the car. They were then taken to a safe house where they stayed for 6 months.Testimony of Warrant officersWarrant officers Qegu and Sithole testified about the events, which led to the arrest of the accused and the rescue of the 2nd complainant. Both officers were part of the Hawks unit and specially trained to work in the field of human trafficking. Qegu was with Sithole when they were assigned to attend to a case at Pretoria North Children’s Court. Qegu testified that she and Sithole attended court and met with magistrate Hitchcock who had made the report for police intervention. They also met V1, the 1st complainant there. She informed them how she and the 2nd complainant were being kept by the accused as sex workers against their will. The officers went to this venue after V1 made a call to establish that the accused was there. V1 pointed out the house but remained hidden in the vehicle. Before gaining entry to the accused premises she warned the girl inside not to run away as they were the police. The accused took some time to let them in.Except for a pair of pants, the accused was naked. The other person in the room was V2, who was very scantily dressed sitting on the bed drinking a beer. Because of the way the victim was dressed she took her to the bathroom whilst Sithole dealt with the accused. She described V2’s condition as being in a state of shock, disorientated and mostly incoherent. It appeared as if she was drunk or on drugs and was laughing for no reason. In the bathroom, V2 told her that shortly before the accused had given her drugs, which she smoked, he had sexual intercourse with her without consent. The accused told her to flush the rest of those drugs down the toilet when the officers knocked on the door. A glass pipe was found in the bathroom cabinet, which was placed in a sealed forensic exhibit bag. On inspection, a trace of a white powder-like substance was detected on the toilet seat. There was no food in the fridge.Both complainants were taken to a safe house and the accused was taken to the Brooklyn police station where he was charged the following day. The complainants were taken for medico legal examinations on the 14 May 2013 being the first available date. At the safe house, both complainants showed signs of drug withdrawal symptoms. V1 had red rashes on her body and V2 required specialist examination of her stomach. She arranged for victim impact reports to be compiled by police psychologist Major Stollarz.The witness stated that she booked out the exhibit bag of the evidence collected on the scene and took to the laboratory for forensic analysis. The analysis determined that it contained cocaine. The witness attempted to verify the address in Thembisa furnished by the accused where he allegedly worked. It led them to a Gold Exchange business. The owner, who also happened to be Nigerian, was questioned and he stated that he did not know the accused.Also booked into the SAP 13 register were all cell phones recovered from the accused and victims. These were sent for the data to be downloaded. The witness concluded her testimony by referring to a set of documents, some of which she obtained from V1 and some of which were found at the accused residence. These related to placement advertisements for sexual services under different names with deposit slips and receipts as proof of payment made to Sex Trader and Escort SA. All exhibits were handed in free of objection from the defence. In cross-examination, it was put to the witness that the accused knew nothing about the glass pipe, had not seen it before and did not hand it to V2. The witness’s explanation for the delay in taking V2 for a medico legal examination was that the events fell over a weekend and she stayed alone with her child. No other officer was available to take her to the doctor. It was put to the witness that the rape allegation was made only to make the case look stronger; the accused never had sexual intercourse with the victim on the day in question. He maintained that there was food in the fridge. It was also put to her that the accused would say that he had no knowledge of the documents relating to the advertisements in Sex Trader and Escort SA and saw them for the first time in court. He denied that the cell phone numbers appearing on the receipts were his.Warrant Officer Sithole’s testified and his evidence was in line with that of the testimony of Qegu. He confirmed that on meeting V1 she informed them that from 2009 the accused forced her to stay with him and used her as a sex worker. He stated that he did notice that the complainant was wearing lingerie and struggling to walk. Qegu took her into the bathroom. She was talking loudly, laughing and he did not find anything on the accused’s possession. In cross-examination, Sithole stated that Qegu informed him about the glass pipe she found when they were leaving the scene. After obtaining the accused’s consent, the witness read the accused’s entire Warning Statement, which he took on the day following the arrest into the record and it was received into evidence.As a follow-up to the Warning Statement he enquired and was informed by V1 that it was the accused who took away her motor bike. Under cross-examination and according to the witness’s recall, V2 told them that the accused had just finished raping her when they entered the room. It was also put to Sithole that the reason for the delay in having the medical examination done was to find something to link the accused to the offence. The defence introduced into evidence a map and set of photographs of the accused’s residence in Sandalwood Road for the purposes of showing the walking distance from the complex to the security point and the shopping centre.Testimony of the clinical psychologistMajor Stollarz, a clinical psychologist, testified as an expert witness. She adduced evidence based on a victimology report, which she complied at the request of the state. The purpose of her report and evidence was to assist the court in understanding the behaviour of victims of human trafficking from a psychological point of view, and to do so about the two complainants in the case. The conclusion she reached in her report was that ‘the complainants in the present matter were both, due to a number of developmental factors and traumas, and their abuse of substances, vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking. During the time that led up to their rescue they were subjected to witnessing and experiencing physical and sexual violence, threats, and encouragement of their addictions. Neither complainant wished to remain in the environment that they were in, but believed that they were unable to leave due to a number of psychological factors regarding the accused control over them, which included their fear of their own, or their families’ safety, substance addiction and lack of other viable alternatives. These victims were therefore exposed to the typical mechanisms used by traffickers to keep their victims in a web of trafficking that extended beyond the mere physical control to the expansive grip of psychological control’. There was no challenge to her testimony – the defence recorded that the accused had no objections and she was not cross-examined on her evidence. No additional psychiatric or other expert evidence was presented to the court.Statements of the accusedThe accused testified that he was born in Nigeria and came to South Africa in 2006. He entered South Africa on a visitor’s permit and later sought asylum as a refugee to reside legally in the country. One day, he met V1 by chance whilst walking in Sunnyside. He stopped her and spoke to her. She told him she was divorced, had one child and stayed in Pretoria North with her parents. She also informed him that she was a prostitute working on the streets, as she needed money to buy drugs. He told her it was ok because he loved her. He told her he liked her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. She agreed, and they began dating. They were in a relationship and she once slept over at his place. She took him to her home to meet her parents and they became very close. She also wanted to stay with him in Sunnyside and he agreed.By the end of 2009, they began living together. The accused stated that because he worked in Thembisa, he would leave home in the morning and return in the evening. He suspected that for the first 3 months together she continued being a prostitute because she was not home in the evenings. When he confronted her about this and she left to live with her parents. In this time, the accused informed her that he had moved to live in Faerie Glen. She returned to live with him and he did not want her engaging in prostitution anymore. She returned to live with her parents and began working as a receptionist for about 4 months. They continued seeing each other during this time and she was expecting his child in 2010. She alternated between staying with the accused and her parents. After giving birth, he visited the baby at her parent’s home. During February 2011 she brought the baby over and stayed with the accused for 2 weeks before going back to live with her parents. The accused then moved to live with a friend in Loskop Street. During this time, he was sending money to her using Shoprite money market. The reason she stayed there was because she had a sickly daughter. During 2013, she called him from Sunnyside for financial help as she had pawned her motor bike to buy drugs. He paid to have this bike released and she began living with him. He kept her bike away from her to avoid her using it again to obtain drugs. However, he allowed her to use it to visit her parents. V1 then returned to her parent’s home and the accused moved to live in Sandalwood Drive. Two months later, she called him to get directions to his new residence. They began living happily together once again. He had no idea what she whilst he was at work.One day she asked for money to place an advert offering her sexual services as she was bored staying alone and did not want to work on the streets. He refused. Two days later, he saw receipts for payments from newspapers and the internet relating to such adverts. He confronted her, and she confirmed that these related to her. He started discovering used condoms in the house and realised she was still engaging in prostitution. Although he wanted her to leave, he allowed her to stay on out of love. There was a time when her mother visited on a Sunday and they all spent time together. She even accompanied them to the mall and did shopping. He always ensured there were groceries in the house and they lived happily without any problems as ‘boyfriend and girlfriend’.Regarding the main charge of human trafficking, he maintained that V1 was his girlfriend with whom he had a child and they were in love. She was in contact with her family. They shared a bond. She had keys to the premises and could come and go as she pleased. He had his own business from which he made money and provided for her and their child. The income from managing the sale of broken gold and diamonds business brought in a high profit. At times he earned up to R10 000.00 a month and he also got money from gambling.  This enabled him to pay the rent, buy a car and see to his expenses. He received no money from her and earned no money off her. He had never supplied her with drugs and had no idea how and from where she got it. On a question by the court at the end of his testimony, he admitted that she told him she bought “rocks” from Arcadia or Sunnyside. She used drugs without him knowing or seeing her use it. She engaged in prostitution only to buy drugs, as there was always food in the house. Only on one occasion, did he see and become aware that a client came to the house for sexual favours. He denied ever having assaulted her.Regarding V2, he stated that he knew her boyfriend Chooks and that is how he met her. Chooks had moved to Pretoria from Johannesburg and was looking out for a place where his girlfriend could live for a while. Both he and V1 agreed that V2 could stay with them. According to his evidence, she was only there for 3 weeks. He was aware that she was originally from Vereeniging, but was staying in Johannesburg. He denied having bought V1 from his friend and stated that had no personal relationship with her. He had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. He also knew nothing about her drug addiction and denied having supplied her with any drugs. He strongly denied the allegations that he had raped her on two occasions and did not know why she said this. According to him, V2 was surprised and questioned the police as to why the accused was being arrested, as V1 was the accused’s boyfriend. For days after his arrest, the police also mention nothing concerning a charge of rape. He got to know for the first time of such charge in court.According to him, if the police found a pipe in the bathroom they would have shown it to him and asked for an explanation. He denied that any drugs were found by the police.In cross-examination, it emerged that he came on a visiting visa, and did not apply for a business one although he started his own business at the end of 2006. He could not say with certainty when he obtained his asylum permit or where his passport was. He could not explain why his brother at the gold exchange business told the police he was not working there. Thereafter he was examined regarding V1’s version and his responses were a denial, either that he had no knowledge or could not comment on it. He did confirm that V1 explained to him and he knew what “rocks” were, but he had not seen these drugs. At first, he stated that he noticed a change in her behaviour when she used drugs and he knew exactly when she was using drugs because she broke out into boils on her face and body. He had often seen her in a drugged state. Under later examination, he stated that she never showed any difference in behaviour if she did not use drugs. He held the belief that no person addicted to drugs could be controlled and that a drug addict could stop taking drugs anytime they chose unless they liked taking drugs.Regarding V2, his earlier testimony was that he had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. Under cross-examination, he stated that V1 informed him that V2 had joined her on the internet. Although he stated that he never saw her getting visitors for sexual favours, this new version was in stark contrast with what he had previously said. He stated that he was fully dressed when the police came to arrest him. He denied that Warrant officer Qegu, before gaining entry to his premises, issued any warning to V2 not to run as they came to rescue her. Further, V2 was trying to defend him by offering an explanation but the police told her not to get involved. He denied that V2 was in the condition she was as described by the police officers at the time of his arrest. His evidence was that V2 was coached and told to say all the things she testified about and she told the police on the scene that they were arresting the wrong person. He disputed that the glass pipe containing traces of drugs was found in his premises because it was not shown to him. Likewise, he stated that if V2 told the officer she was raped they would have told him about it and he only got to know about this charge in court. When it was pointed out to him that the offence of rape appeared in paragraph 2 of his warning Statement, his response was that he was never asked if he understood it at the time. He further denied that he signed that relevant portion of the statement. His explanation why both complainants made the same allegations against him was that they probably discussed it to implicate him. He could not explain why he was not registered as a taxpayer although on his version he earned R10 000.00 a month. When asked why his name on the Asylum Permit was different to the name he gave on the warning statement, he said it was a mistake, which was not corrected. In re-examination, he explained that it was a spelling error made by official at Home Affairs.",trafficking in persons,0
"The appellant's version was that she met the three complainants on the beach near Maputo in Mozambique where the complainants worked as prostitutes. They told her that they wanted to work as prostitutes in South Africa. She then agreed to accommodate the complainants as prostitutes in Pretoria where she resided. The appellant had a hair salon in the central business district of Pretoria where she also sold clothing. From the evidence, it is clear that the appellant knew the complainants from Mozambique. The appellant commuted between Pretoria and Mozambique regularly to visit and sell clothing. When she returned from Mozambique after one of her trips and while the appellant was in Pretoria, one of the complainants phoned the appellant and said that they were near Komatipoort. The appellant testified that she then asked a friend of hers to transport the complainants to Pretoria. When they arrived in Pretoria, the three complainants stayed with the appellant in her flat in Silver Lakes, east of Pretoria. The flat was too small and the appellant decided to rent a 3-bedroom house in Moreleta Park, a short distance from her flat. A brothel was kept at that house. The appellant was arrested and some of the complainants were taken into custody there. The Regional Magistrate rejected the appellant's evidence on grounds of credibility. Her rejected evidence only differed from that of the complainants in respect of the complainants' alleged prostitution in Mozambique and the collection of the complainants near Komatipoort. The balance of the evidence that led to the appellant's conviction (which she never challenged on appeal) was based to a large extent on circumstantial evidence. The evidence of the complainants was accepted. Their evidence was that they did meet the appellant in Mozambique where she promised them work in her hair salon and an opportunity to study while working there. They were looking for a better life. She then arranged for them to come to South Africa and the appellant in person collected all three of them at or near Komatipoort. The complainants testified that they worked for the appellant at her hair salon in Pretoria for a few days. They were forced to smoke cannabis and to have sexual intercourse with several men daily. They said they were not paid for doing so.One of the complainants returned to Mozambique before the appellant's arrest. She returned because she refused to perform all the sexual acts demanded by the appellant's elderly male clients. She was whisked away from the appellant's establishment and transported by taxi to Mozambique. She was given a passport containing the photograph of another individual to pass through immigration counters at the border posts. The passport was, when she was dropped off in Maputo, taken back by the taxi driver. After she reported her ordeal to her boyfriend and family in Maputo (her boyfriend gave evidence in the Court a quo) they went to the Mozambican Police to report the incident. After having reported the incident, the policeman to whom it was reported demanded payment of money from the victim and her relatives and boyfriend before he would conduct an investigation. The investigation only later followed after the victim and her boyfriend contacted a senior police official in Mozambique who then, in collaboration with the South African Police Service, secured the appellant's prosecution.",trafficking in persons,1

"The accused, Mr Veeran Palan and Ms Edwina Norris are charged with ten (10) counts which include: Count 1 and 2 is the illegal and intentional trafficking for sexual of complainant 1 and 2 in contravention of section 71(1) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and related Matters) Amendment Act, 32 of 2007.Count 3 is the illegal keeping of a brothel in contravention of S2 of the Sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957.Count 4 and 5 is the charge of procuring the two complainants to have unlawful carnal intercourse with someone else in contravention of s a, b, and C of s10 of the sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957Count 6 is knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitutionCount 7 and 8 is kidnappingCount 9 and 10 is conspiring with an unidentifiable person to commit sexual offence. The crime of trafficking was prosecuted in terms of section 70 of the Sexual Offences Act, 32 of 2007. The Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013 was assented to by the President of the Republic of South Africa on 28 July 2013 but had not been enacted. The first complainant CB is a 29 year old wife and mother of four young children, testified that during 2013 she was living with her husband and four children in Cape Town. She was unemployed and with a grade 10 education it was difficult to find a job. During July 2013 accused 2’s mother approached her with a cell phone and said that accused 2 wanted to speak to her. She had known accused 2 for some 12 years because they had been at school together and lived in the same street. She knew that accused 2 was working away from her family home. Accused 2 offered her a job as a cleaner in a Margate hotel in KZN. CB was keen to earn an income and undertook to speak to her husband. Accused 2 promised to phone her again with more details. CB’s husband did not have a good feeling about the offer. Accused 2 thereafter phoned again and told CB that Vees, her employer, would buy her a ticket to travel to KZN by bus. CB arranged with her mother to take care of the children. Her mother undertook to obtain more information about the job from accused 2 and also from Vees. Later that day accused 2’s mother called CB to her again and she was shown a photograph of accused 2 in what appeared to be a waitress’s uniform. This finally persuaded CB to accept the job offer and she contacted accused 2 to tell her. She enquired about the salary she would receive and accused 2 told her that she would hear when she was there. CB spoke to her husband about the job offer and although he was initially not happy to let her go but told her that she could if she wanted to. He too had spoken to accused 2.  On the 17th July 2013 she received a bus ticket confirmation by text from Vees. He also advised her that SN second complainant, also from Cape Town, would accompany her. She knew SN. CB’s father searched the Internet and reported that there was a Margate hotel in the Port Shepstone area. She now was convinced that all was above board with the job offer.  The next morning her mother took her to the bus terminus in Cape Town and travelled with SN to Port Shepstone. During the journey she stayed in telephonic contact with her mother and with Vees. They arrived in Port Shepstone on the 19th July 2013 at 9.30 in the evening and phoned accused 2. Vees, who turned out to be accused 1, was there to pick them up. He took them to his home. She had no idea where the hotel was that she was to work at. She had never been to KZN. Accused 1’s wife was at the house and she showed the two women their bedrooms, told them to bath before they would have something to eat and said that accused 2 was still at work and would be there shortly. Accused 2 arrived with two other ladies, J and M. Accused 2 was not in a waitress uniform but like the other two ladies she was scantily dressed. CB and SN thought they were dressed like prostitutes. Accused 1 made them sit down at a table and then disclosed to them that they were in fact not there to work in a hotel but that they would work as prostitutes; that accused 2 and the other ladies worked for him as sex workers. He said that CB and SN had no option but to do it as well since they needed to pay for the bus tickets he had provided. It had cost R1200 apiece. CB did not know what to say. She was nervous because she had noticed a handgun tucked into the back of accused 1’s trousers. Prostitution was however unacceptable to her. Accused 2 did not say anything either. She asked accused 2 what was to happen and accused 2 apologized for having lied to CB and SN. She explained that she had to find a replacement for herself before she would be allowed to return to Cape Town. This was confirmed by accused 1.      Accused 1 wanted them to start working that very night but CB and SN said that they were too tired. CB sent her mother a text on her cell phone after 1 am to tell her what had happened. After breakfast the next morning accused 2 took them to a shopping centre and bought them provocative clothing and underwear. That afternoon they were taken to the house of accused 1’s friend, a Dr M where they were entertained with food and alcohol. In the meantime CB’s uncle S phoned SN’s phone. He wanted to know where CB was finding herself but she was unable to give any directions. That evening the women were told to put on the clothes and underwear bought for them. Four men arrived at the house and the five women were told to stand in a line. The other women were each picked by a man (including accused 2) and CB considered herself fortunate that no-one picked her. She remained in the dining room while the others went to the bedrooms for sex. J was the first to return and she received a call about a stag party. When the other women were done, accused 1 drove the six of them to a Lodge at the Crocodile farm. Five men approached accused 1 and enquired how much the party and the girls would cost. Accused 1 advised them that it would cost R1000 for a stripping session and R350 for half an hour with a girl. There were many men at what turned out to be a bachelor party. An Indian man approached CB for sex. He paid accused 1 R400 and took CB to a room. She however disclosed to him that she was not a prostitute and how it had happened that she landed up there. She made it clear that she did not want him to have sex with him. The man undertook to help her and they conversed. Accused 1 arrived after a while and said that time was up and the man had to leave. Accused 1 drove the girls, except for accused 2 who stayed at the party, back home. On the way J was dropped at Dr M’s house. There was further business and four men arrived. This time CB was chosen by one of the men. SN was also chosen but said she did not feel good about it. The man took CB to a room and again she explained that she was not a prostitute and that she was there against her will. The man said he just wanted to converse and did not want sex although he had paid accused 1 R350. CB and the man conversed and when they left the bedroom they found accused 1 and Samantha arguing. At that moment CB’s mother phoned accused 1. Accused 1 told her that CB was at work but her mother had heard CB’s voice and accused 1 then told her they had just arrived from work. Although he was angry he passed the phone to CB but remained in attendance. As a result CB was unable to tell her mother what was happening. She said to her mother that everything was fine and that she could contact her in the morning. Accused 1 was upset about the phone call because he felt that CB’s mother was messing with his business. He threatened CB. She did not end the call with the result that her mother could hear how accused 1 was arguing with her and SN.     Between 3 and 4 am accused 1’s son and two other youngsters arrived at the house. Accused 1 did not want his son to see him; so accused 1’s wife (who happened to be a lady of Chinese origin) attended to business. Accused 1’s son went to sit in the car outside and a 17 year old boy paid her R400 to have sex with CB. Once they were in the bedroom CB disclosed to the prospective customer that she did not want to engage in prostitution and did not want to have sex with him. The youngster insisted and removed her clothes and told her to give him a condom. When she would not, he took one from a table in the room, put it on and told her to lie down. She resisted but he pushed her onto her back on the bed and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her. Although she pushed him off her, he mounted and penetrated her once again. She managed to push him off once again and he left the room and complained to accused 1. Accused 1 came into the bedroom and told her that he would see her in the morning. The next morning accused 1 confronted her and SN. He was rude and said they owed him R250 each for the food consumed by them as well as another R100 for advertising their bodies on the Internet. They were also to pay for their accommodation. From the R150, R100 and R50 respectively which he had given her for having been with three customers, she gave him R200. Accused 2 suggested that they be taken to a pub but accused 1 did not want them to go out and drink. Accused 2 then lied to him and said they were going out to eat and go to the cinema. Four of them took a taxi to a pub and enjoyed a few drinks and the outing. Uncle S again phoned SN who then enquired from others what the name of the pub was and conveyed this to Uncle S. At that point accused 2 was outside with another man. Half an hour later two police officers arrived. One had a photograph of CB which uncle S had sent to them. He took CB and SN with him to the police station in Port Shepstone where they made statements. At some point accused 2, accused 1 and his wife arrived. Accused 1 demanded to know why the police had taken the women there. CB identified accused 1 to the police and he was arrested. Then they enquired which one was Bonnie and when accused 2 was pointed out, she too was arrested. CB and SN were taken to accused 1’s house to fetch their clothes. Accused 1s wife allowed them to. According to CB she had been afraid of accused 1 and his firearm and the manner in which he talked to them and therefore had not made an attempt to leave the house earlier. They were also watched by accused 1 and his wife. On one of the three occasions when she was picked by customers, she was too scared to refuse. One look at accused 1’s face persuaded her to oblige.  Her understanding was that while accused 1 made all the arrangements with men, his wife managed the prostitutes. She saw him receive all the money.      When asked in the course of cross-examination why she had not run away from the house of accused 1, she told the court that she was afraid to do so. She thought accused 1 to be well-connected and she did not know whom to trust. She at one point said that she could not think clearly The court found that the evidence clearly showed that accused 1 and 2 had employed deception to lure the two complainants to Port Shepstone for the purpose of getting them to engage in prostitution and provided the finances and means of transferring them here. They were also harboured and accommodated by accused 1. The women did not freely and with full knowledge of all the material facts consent thereto. Consequently both accused are found guilty of the main counts of trafficking, illegal keeping of a brothel, procuring the victims to have unlawful carnal intercourse, knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitution (accused 2 was acquitted of this charge) and kidnapping. The second accused were acquitted on count 9 and 10.  Accused 1 was sentenced to 10 years and a fine of R10,000 or 5 months imprisonment. Accused 2 was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendant, a 28 year old man, arranged a customary marriage with the complainant’s uncle which led to her abduction. The complainant was, at the time, 14 years old. The custom of abducting girls for the purposes of marriage, sometimes with the permission of their family, is known as ukuthwala in South Africa. The complainant was restrained and transported to the defendant’s village. She attempted to escape two times, and was successful the second time in arriving back to her village, but was subsequently apprehended by her uncle and returned to the defendant. She was then beaten and raped eight times, and was locked in the house when the defendant and his relatives were going out. After a few days, the complainant jumped over the fence and sought help from the police.",trafficking in persons,1
"With the exception of victim LK (counts 5 and 6), who was abducted under false pretences, three girls; JC, CM and AC (mentioned in counts 1-4 and 6-8), all under the age of 16 at the time, were through misrepresentations made to them and their parents lured to South Africa by a certain ‘Aunt Juliet Chauke’  to visit family and / or with the promise of their attending schools and obtaining a better education than what they could get in Mozambique. Accused no 2, Violet Chauke, is Juliet’s younger sister, while Alice Chauke, AC’s mother was Juliet’s elder sister.  According to the uncontested evidence of these children, Juliet Chauke, who has since disappeared back into Mozambique and never charged in this matter, has also ‘trafficked’ her younger sister Violet Chauke, to South Africa in a similar way, but, later, when she became adult, she got a work and remained in South Africa.JC was sent by her parents with Juliet and others to come and visit over the school holidays – also with a promise that she would return, which never happened. When she asked Juliet why she is not going back, she said that there was no money. AC was sent by her mother, Juliet’s and Violet’s elder sister to South Africa with a promise of better schooling, which never materialized – but she was never allowed to return. LK was abducted under false pretences after her primary care giver, her grandmother, refused Juliet permission to bring her to South Africa for better schooling. Later, however, Juliet found her on the way and told her that her grandmother had now agreed and, she was then made to accompany Juliet and others. She was also never enrolled at school in South Africa and not allowed to return. CM came to South Africa with Juliet in the presence of her own mother, Alice and her younger sister JM and others. The purported reason for their trip was to visit family members over the school holidays, after which they would return. Her mother returned, but she and her sister remained behind. When the mother later phoned and asked when they would be sent back, Juliet said that there was no money for that and that she would enrol them at school in South Africa. JC, AC and LK were brought to South Africa in 2009, while CM was brought during 2010.Since none of them had valid passports, all of them were at different occasions smuggled over or through the border fence with South Africa, while Juliet used the border gate with a valid passport. On the other side of the border they were met by Juliet and other people, (sometimes a man perceived to be Juliet’s husband) and they were eventually transported to the place called Makostering (Rhenosterhoek) plantation village. This lumberjacks’ village is a very remote place with no direction or information boards, and a stranger would find it difficult to find the place without help and would experience true desolation if left there without food or shelter. A desolated place indeed, and if a stranger was brought there and chased away, as some of these children were threatened should they not do what they were told, they would literally not have anywhere to go.Once resident in one of the small houses in the village, these girls were at different times, sometimes in the presence of others, taken (or sent) by Juliet, or fetched by accused no 1, to a larger house, about 1.5 kilometres away from the village, which reportedly belonged to accused no 1, the manager of the plantation / timber farm, and which was used as a residence by him. All of these witnesses described how they were then from time to time made to enter the bedroom, where they would be undressed (either by Juliet or accused no 1), or, later when they got used to it, they themselves did so, and they were also raped by accused no 1 on these occasions. All of them, with the exception of JC, who was raped only once, were raped several times according to their evidence. Each time they were being taken to the larger house by Juliet, or, later when they got used to their being exploited in this way, called or sent (by Juliet or, in her absence, by Violet, accused no 2) to go and attend accused no 1’s sexual pleasures. Sometimes he would pay Juliet, sometimes he would give them money to give to either Juliet or Violet, accused no 2. JC said that, when she was subsequent to her rape called to Mabuza’s house, she told the messengers that they should tell him that she is in her periods so that she did not have to go, and thus she evaded being raped a second time.Three of them (AC, CM and JC) testified that they were during the first time threatened by accused no 1 with a fire arm should they not do what he says. Some of them (excluding only AC who was at the very first time forced to do so) at first refused to sleep with Mabuza, accused no 1, after which they were threatened by Juliet that they would be chased away, that they would not have anywhere to go or food to eat and, sometimes food like meat would be refused. This motivated the children to simply do as they were told.It further emerged from the evidence of the children that there were times that Juliet would be absent – on her errands to Mozambique to traffick others or, simply to visit – and that the children would then be left in the care of her younger sister, Violet, accused no 2. From time to time, when Mabuza wanted to see one of them, he would phone Violet when she would ready them and send them to him (or he would come and fetch them), where they would be raped as before. Sometimes he would give them money that they had to give to accused no 2. During these times, Violet would care for them (harbour them) by giving them food, whilst fully knowing what they were there for and she would ready them and send them to accused no 1 at his request. All of the girls knew all too well they would be left destitute if they did not do as told.The history described by some of the children about accused no 2, Violet, who was also trafficked (by her own elder sister) to South Africa for the sexual pleasure of accused no 1, shows that, when Violet became too old for his attentions, she got a work in the plantation at Rhenosterhoek, and that Juliet then had to go and look for new young blood to come and replace her.One of the things that disturbed the children the most, was that, whenever they reported to Juliet that the accused had injured their private parts during the rapes, and that they bled, she did not respond or help them in any way. To AC she simply said that she would be alright and she would get used to it eventually. To the contrary, when they verbalised their unwillingness to be subjected to rape, or when they subsequently complained and appeared to be unwilling, Juliet threatened them with abandonment in this desolate place, where all of them were strangers. When they requested to be sent back, Juliet always indicated that there was no money. When they enquired about being sent to school, there was no money. To LK she said that she had to sleep with accused no 1 to get money to buy school uniforms. All this while they were related to Juliet, or knew her well enough to view her in a position of authority and trust and who seriously betrayed the trust of the children.One day, JC decided to pack her things and run away from there and, at school, she was found out. The principal and the social worker, Lucia Sonya Khoza were summoned to speak to her. The most that they got out of her was that the other children that she left behind on the farm at Rhenosterhoek was being maltreated and sexually abused. When this was reported to the principal and the social worker, reports were made to the police, which led to Ramodike and others going to the village, where the other children were found. They were in a bad shape, clothes in tatters and dirty, their hair unkempt and in dreadlocks, and they were clearly very hungry.This is where the investigation started. The investigation, before the matter was handed over to Nyathi, was however poorly done. Accused no 1 and Violet were arrested only much later. The particular house in which the incidents reportedly happened was never searched. Accused no 1’s fire arm was only later seized. Etcetera. The children were however put in a place of safety and, eventually, when they properly disclosed what happened statements must have been taken from them, which led to the case being investigated with a view to prosecute and the institution of these proceedings.Accused no 1’s evidenceHe stated that he had worked for York Timbers, until he started his own business rendering contracting services to York Timber at Rhenosterhoek and Blystaan from 2001. Juliet Chauke had worked for his enterprise at Blystaan under a sub-contractor.He stated that the first time ever he saw accused no 2, was during 2011 or 2012, when she started working there as a general labourer. He never had any sexual relationship with accused no 2 or any of the children who testified, whom he did not even know. The first time he ever saw the children that testified, is when they appeared on the TV screen during their testimony. He does not know whether his employees could have family members visit or stay with them in the village, because that was York Timbers’ responsibility. If he wanted to employ more people, he had to ask York Timbers whether his people could use more houses in the village.He cannot deny that the children who testified were staying in that village from 2009 to 2012 as they said they did. He cannot dispute the ages that the children testified they were at the time, nor their reported dates of birth. He however said that he can dispute that the children were ever raped in the main house, because at the relevant time, 2009 to 2011, neither he nor anyone else lived there. He does not know how the children could know of the suite bathroom in the main bedroom to that house. He specifically denied that he ever wore the firearm to work from 2006 until the date of his arrest, and he could therefore not say how the children could have known that he even possesses a firearm. There has never been any bad blood between him and Juliet, or between him and Violet, that could have turned the kids against him. He cannot say whether any of the children could have harboured a motive to falsely implicate him with these serious allegations, but he had overheard that they might have thought that he had a lot of money and that they would get some money if they falsely implicated him. It was pointed out to him that this version of his did not fly, because none of the children, out of their own, laid a charge against him. This case was uncovered by social workers and the police, not by the children. He however insisted that all of them were lying, just to get him into trouble.Accused no 2’s versionAccused no 2 never testified, but her version that was put to the children was that she never had anything to do with their maltreatment, and that she only gave them shelter and food during the absence of Juliet. One or two of the children agreed with this, but others made it clear that, in Juliet’s absence, she pertinently readied them and sent them to accused no 1 at his telephonic requests, and that, at occasion, she received money from accused no 1 via them. These allegations by the children were never denied by her in evidence that could be tested through cross-examination for the veracity thereof.Examination of the victims by a forensic nurse and a medical doctorKok is a forensic nurse and Grabe a medical doctor and professor, who is an expert in dealing with the examination of victims, especially children in sexual assault cases. Kok saw injuries on the private parts of only certain of the girls that she examined, but was quick to add, which was confirmed by Grabe, that the absence of injuries does not necessarily exclude sexual penetration. She was however clearly inexperienced compared to Grabe, who saw more clear indications on the private parts of all the girls she examined that was indicative of sexual penetration of their genitals. This evidence serves to support the four complainants’ versions that they have been sexually penetrated. Of course, these witnesses could not say whether the children had been raped and by whom, although the lesions on their private part were indicative of tears that have healed, which suggested that at least some force had to be used to effect penetration. In her professional opinion based on scientific observations, Grabe, in addition, also put the relevant ages of the girls at the same level than the respective ages that they gave her and the court.",trafficking in persons,1
"Second accused, Lionel Richard Ball, had seen “groups of prostitutes” on the side of the road previously, and asked his domestic worker and co-accused, Nokuzola Ntonga, specifically to fetch V. for him. Evidently, amongst these “groups of prostitutes” stood young girls who were not prostitutes. V. was not a prostitute, and may have been a virgin.Ntonga went to fetch V. from her home, where she resided with her elder sister. V. had known Ntonga prior to the incident. V. was not home, but her sister told Ntonga that V. was at a friend or relative’s house. Ntonga then retrieved V. from the friend or relative’s house. Ntonga told V. and the caretakers of the house that she was taking V. to see a social worker to get shoes and clothes.Rather, Ntonga drove V. to Ball’s home in East London where Ball allegedly raped V. He then allegedly forced her into the shower and locked her in his bedroom when a friend and witness in the case, Raath, visited Ball’s house for a few hours. Raath testified that he did see a young black child, but did not know if she was a girl or what her purpose was of being there. After Raath left, Ball drove V. home. Ball admitted that she was at his home, but claims he only let her watch television, take a shower, and gave her clothes and R200 to purchase shoes.",trafficking in persons,1
"This case involved an urgent application by Mavericks Revue bar, a “gentlemen’s club” in Cape Town, to stop the Department of Home Affairs from terminating its corporate permits, pending a separate judicial review of the withdrawal of the permits. Mavericks Revue bar required the corporate permits in order to legally employ foreign dancers at the establishment.The background to the dispute was that Mavericks had applied to the Department in March 2010 to have 143 out of 200 corporate permits replaced, claiming that they were “lost, mislaid or stolen over many years”. In deciding whether to allow the application the Department learnt Mavericks had not complied with the relevant legislation and the conditions of the corporate worker authorisation certificates. It was claimed by the Department that Mavericks’ corporate workers were not employees but independent contractors who were not paid a wage or salary and that Mavericks’ failed to keep proper records, inform the Department when a worker left, ensure corporate workers complied with provisions of the legislation and ensure foreign workers departed after completion of their tour of duty. On the basis of these reasons, among others, the Department decided to withdraw the corporate permits.",trafficking in persons,0
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"In January 2009, Peter Michael Roberts (accused 1) and six co-accused were arrested by the erstwhile Directorate of Special Operations (the Scorpions) following a police operation codenamed Operation May. The enterprise traded and distributed approximately 30 tons of shucked abalone over a period of 40 months. The State argued that Peter Roberts was the mastermind and that his co-accused were central to the enterprise.Two of the accused, who were arrested five kilometres from the Lebombo border post between South Africa and Mozambique, are not subject to this trial since both pleaded guilty and entered a plea bargain with the State. Both were convicted and sentenced but not incarcerated. The remaining five accused all denied complicity in the offences, which included conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activities (2005 – 2009), in the illicit trade in and transportation of abalone – in a truck with a concealed roof – to Mozambique.The State demonstrated that Peter Roberts was indeed central to the enterprise by relying on witness testimony, documentary evidence obtained through a seizure operation, and transcripts from intercepted phone calls to and from Roberts. It was found that their operation possessed, transported, and exported abalone from the Eastern Cape to Mozambique. The illegal trade in abalone was the predicate offence to the more serious crime of racketeering, that carries a heavier sentence, which necessitated the State to demonstrate the existence of an enterprise with a pattern of more than two incidents and show the involvement of the accused in the enterprise. The racketeering pattern was established by triangulating the abovementioned evidence to cases in which s204 witnesses (see commentary) testified about the complicity of the accused in similar cases in which the witnesses were duly convicted and sentenced.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"3 individuals were charged in the criminal trial for manufacturing methamphetamine in contravention of the Drugs Act. The main accused S.P. was accused of operating a drug manufacturing laboratory from his residence. He owned the property. The State also brought civil forfeiture proceedings against the property which S.P., as the owner of the property, opposed.S.P. was criminally charged with contraventions of the Drugs Act. He was found manufacturing methamphetamine in a laboratory in his home. He was however acquitted of these charges on the basis of technical problems with a search and seizure warrant that led to the discovery of the laboratory. The State also brought civil asset forfeiture proceedings against the property on the basis that the property was used to manufacture drugs. This application was successful, notwithstanding several appeals, including an appeal to the Constitutional Court by S.P.The criminal proceedings and asset forfeiture proceedings were instituted simultaneously. S.P. brought an application to stay the civil forfeiture proceedings pending the finalization of his criminal case. He contended that the civil proceedings would violate his right to remain silent. This application was dismissed and forfeiture granted as the court found that the decision to oppose forfeiture of his property did not amount to a compulsion to speak in violation of his right to remain silent. S.P. had a choice to defend the forfeiture application or he could remain silent. The court held that it was not required to protect him from the consequences of exercising this difficult choice. The court ordered that the property be forfeited to the State on the basis that it was used to manufacture drugs in contravention of the Drugs Act.After his acquittal in the criminal case S.P. argued that the forfeiture was unfair as the criminal court had acquitted him of the charges. His property could therefore not be forfeited as the criminal court had not been satisfied that the crimes he was accused of were in fact committed. The appeal court found that the state had proved on a civil standard that the property was used to manufacture methamphetamine and the findings of the criminal court were irrelevant to the forfeiture proceedings.S.P. then appealed to the Constitutional Court asking the court to declare the forfeiture order an unfair violation of his fair trial rights (to remain silent, not to incriminate himself) and his right to property. He also ask the court to find that the lower court should have granted him a stay of the civil forfeiture proceedings pending. He was unsuccessful in his constitutional challenge and the property was forfeited to the State.",drug offences,0
"This case mainly concerns the conduct of alleged human trafficking and facilitation to such crimes which was prosecuted by the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa. During the period 1 April 2016 up to September 2016, defendant 3, namely C.J. Obasi, harboured at least two victims at Jaspit Court with the alleged intent to exploit his victims sexually. Both of the victims who testified as witnesses before the Court were first brought to contact with the said defendant by their acquaintances. Prior to arriving at Jaspit Court, the victims had been living in vulnerable conditions resulting from irregular immigrant status, addiction to drugs, as well as complicated family issues. And such conditions were later taken advantage of by the traffickers to gain control over the victims. Although victims seemlingly came to Jaspit Court out of their free will, they were subsequently controlled with drugs, threatened by force, and repeatedly assaulted by the said defendant. The victims worked as prostitutes during such period of time but were forced to hand over all the incomes they had made. They also had to entertain “smoking clients”, visitors who come to consume drugs. It was also reported that the victims were pushed to have sexual intercourse with Obasi due to the hierarchical relationship between them. At the same time, the victim enjoyed little personal freedom: they were not allowed to go anywhere on their own during daytime, and later following a failed attempt to escape, they were not allowed to leave the flat at all during daytime.  While defendant 3, Obasi, carried out the major activities, defendant 1, namely Abba, was trained and served to run the “business” in the exact same manner during Obasi’s temporary absence. Defendant 2, Mkhonto, who had once been romantically involved with Obasi, leased to him the property in which the victims were harboured. However, she was not directly involved, nor had she ever met the victims in the entire process.",drug offences,0

"From 2010 to 2014, the defendant Mr Z. conducted a criminal enterprise to fraudulently purchase goods on commercial websites. To this end, Mr Z. used stolen credit card data found on carding forums by himself, Mr P. (the technical advisor of the group) and Mr N. (a member of the group in charge of finding credit card data), as well as credit card data that Mr L. had stolen from his former employer. Mr P. and Mr Z. would then hack into customer accounts on commercial websites and modify their contact information so that the actual customer would not receive any notification of purchase and/or delivery. Mr Z. and N. would then buy goods on commercial websites and send them to parcel collection points. Mr Z and Mr X forged fake IDs and used mules to receive the packages at the collection points. Several people were used as mules: Messrs Y, M, O, Q, V, T, and R. The mules would receive the packages, keep some packages as payment and send the others to Mr Z. so that he could sell them on retailer websites. Several people involved in this criminal organization later started using the same techniques to buy goods on their own behalf.The group managed to place around 2000 orders on shopping websites for an amount estimated to be between EUR 40 000 and 60 000.When they were arrested, Mr Z. and Mr V. were also found in possession of ATM skimmers that they had intended to use to launch an operation to get more credit card data.",cybercrime,1

"Subject of the case are legal proceedings initiated by Cédric H. and his colleagues to challenge the constitutionality of Articles L.622-1 and L 622-4 of the French Code on the Entry and Residence of Foreign Nationals and the Right to Asylum. The applicants claimed that the offence of facilitating the illegal entry, movement and residence of a foreign person infringed upon the principle of fraternity, as it did not sufficiently take into account humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants without material or financial compensation.The French Constitutional court, first of all, clarified that the principle of fraternity enjoyed constitutional value as it is enshrined in Art. 2 and 72-3 of the Constitution and, secondly, that it comprised the freedom to help one another without consideration as to whether the assisted person is legally residing within the French territory. On the other hand, the principle of fraternity must be balanced against the legislature’s responsibility to safeguard public order.  Applied to the legislation at hand, the Court found that criminalizing any assistance to irregular migrants, including when it is given for humanitarian reasons, did not strike a fair balance between the afore-mentioned principles and violated the constitutional provisions on fraternity. The Court, however, dismissed arguments based on the necessity and proportionality principles, legal certainty principle, protection of human dignity, and equality before the law which it considered not to be infringed upon by the legislation in question.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant was accused of facilitating the illegal transit and stay of three Eritrean female migrants (including a minor), who he knew were in France irregularly. The facts occurred on 18 October 2016, between Tende (France) and Nice (France), via La Turbie (Alpes Maritimes, France). The defendant provided transportation and accommodation in his residence to the three irregular migrants.On the afore-mentioned date, the police carried out a traffic control operation in highway A8, close to la Turbie, between 01.00 and 07.00. The defendant was ordered to pull over at approximately 04.45. Authorities realised the defendant was transporting three women, who attempted to hide their faces.The defendant was placed under custody. The search of the vehicle did not reveal anything pertinent to investigations. Later, authorities searched the residence of the defendant, where they found three matrasses placed on the floor and, in the kitchen, nine glasses and bowls as well as a pot with food.Two of the migrants were heard by authorities. One, declared to have fled Eritrea, via the Sahara desert. She went to Sudan and, then, Libya. From there, she left to Italy, by sea, with the assistance of migrant smugglers to whom she paid 3600 USD. She wouldbe attempting to arrive to Germany, where relatives of her resided. She stated to have encountered the defendant by chance, while she and her compatriots where walking towards France. The defendant would have stopped and, realising their tiredness, invited them into the vehicle, without charging them any fees or requesting any advantage in return.The other migrant confirmed the statement of her compatriot. She declared to have paid 3500 USD to be smuggled from Libya into Italy. She would have attempted before to walk towards Germany, in the company of her cousin. However, the latter would have been ran over by a truck and died. On her second attempt, she walked for several days, through the mountains, with her two compatriots. They would be in the process of walking when a vehicle stopped close to them. They asked the driver for help. The defendant accepted to give them a ride without asking any payment or benefit in return.The defendant, in turn, contested the version given by the migrants.  According to him, he had taken charge of the three women in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France), upon finding them in an abandoned building close to associations that aimed to provide humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants. He further explained to usually associate with members of such associations/organisations, particularly those intending to supply food and accommodation to migrants in need. He admitted to have witnessed several conversations without ever directly providing humanitarian assistance himself. However, two days before, while he was going to La Brigue to attend a popular celebration with his 12-year old daughter, he notice four young individuals, appearing to be African, and in inappropriate attire in view of the current season. He decided to stop, namely to sensitise his daughter to the difficulties endured by irregular migrants. He ended up conversing with the four young individuals (allegedly from Darfur), who declared to wish to travel to the coast. However, they were heading to the mountains. The defendant agreed to return at approximately 18.00 and help them. He did as agreed. He took the young men to his residence and gave them food and accommodation for the night. The next day, he gave them a ride to the station of Arcs (France) and paid them a train ticket to the station of Carnoules (France). Following these events, he went to work. At the end of the day, he joined some friends in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France). One of his friends informed him that a number of associations providing humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants intended to invest on a squat in order to ensure accommodation to those in need. This friend would have told the defendant that he would be helping in this endeavour. The defendant decided to accompany his friend to the site at approximately 01.00. After a while, given the late hour, the defendant manifested his intent to return home. One of the individuals on site, proposed that he took the three Eritrean women to his house and, the following day, gave them a ride to the station of Cagnes-Sur-Mer (France). There, they would take the train to Marseille (France) where they would be expected by doctors and other humanitarian workers. With some hesitation, the defendant accepted. He declared to be fully aware of the irregular situation of the women in France. Yet, he acted out of solidarity in view of their dramatic circumstances. He described that, when he met the women, they were tired, fearful and ‘frozen’. They presented apparent wounds and bandages. One of the three Eritrean women was again questioned, this time confirming the version of events reported by the defendant. The latter’s declarations were also corroborated by the analysis of his phone records. On the one hand, many of the defendant’s contacts were indeed individuals well known for their humanitarian work/involvement. On the other hand, a number of messages were illustrative of the defendant’s intent to help migrants in need, in the sense explained by him during questioning. They further supported the facts reported by the defendant. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence as well as the outcome of search and seizure operations. Expert evidence was also considered. Notably, a physician working with Médecins du Monde attested to the debilitating health conditions of the three Eritrean migrants: (i) they presented contusions, wounds, and sprains due to long hours walking; (ii) most concerning, their psychological state was particularly worrying. The expert further noted to be familiar with the squat in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, declaring it to be impossible to deny help, food, clothing and accommodation to the migrants settling therein. In addition, the Defence submitted an affidavit from President of the Ligue des droits de l’Homme(who was not heard in court due to time constrains), according to which the actions of the defendant were defined as “gestures of humanity and solidarity towards human beings in situation of total precariousness”. Legal findings:In responding to the humanitarian justification invoked by the Defence, the Public Prosecutor underlined the difference between ‘rescue’ and ‘aide’. The former implies an immediate danger and it is, hence, a duty. The actions of the defendant were to be integrated, instead, within a more organised help/assistance, which was not connected to a real and imminent danger to the life or safety of others. It thus maintained its argument for the conviction of the defendant for facilitation of illegal transit and stay of irregular migrants in France.The Tribunal de Grande Instance of Nice acquitted the defendant.For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1

"The judgment decides the appeal presented by two individuals (H.F. and M.H.) against their conviction for inter alia migrant smuggling, specifically for procuring and or enabling - in the context of an organised criminal group - the illegal entry, transit and or stay of non EU citizens, in contradiction to EU and domestic law on the matter. On 28 July 2012, after being alerted by the Town Hall of Lunéville (France), the border police – Police Aux Frontières (PAF) – questioned H.F. and another individual. They had tried to acquire a French identity card to the latter by presenting a false certificate of French nationality, copy of fraudulent birth certificate, certificate of loss of identity card as issued by the police, copy of certificate of residence (in an address later determined to be fictitious). The investigations that followed permitted to ascertained as follows:H.F. participated in at least nine similar operations aimed at fraudulently obtaining French identity cards to foreigners. He chose the most appropriate municipalities to carry out the plan. He arranged the logistics and accompanied the foreigners to the police (where they declared to have lost the national identity card so as to gather a corresponding certificate to deliver in the Town Hall), assisting them to collect fraudulent certificates of residence issued by defendant M.H. or an insurance company. H.F. also assisted the foreigner in his or her endeavour in the Town Hall aimed at acquiring national documents in a fraudulent manner. Migrant smuggling activities were carried out in Thiais (France).M.H. participated in at least four operations, in the context of which he supplied falsified certificates of residence. In some instances, he also accompanied the migrants to the Town Hall to assist them in the attempt of acquiring national identity documents. Migrant smuggling activities were carried out in Aubervilliers (France). From the residence of H.F., authorities seized, among other items, a file for the request of a French passport, a certificate of loss of identity card, three replies to requests of birth certificates, 29 extracts of birth certificates, five certificates of French nationality issued to different persons, eight ink-stamps (corresponding to different municipalities) with the writing “certified”. From the residence of M.H., authorities seized inter alia dozens of blank templates of: (i) water invoices, (ii) birth certificates from three municipalities, (iii) blank sheets of paper with the ink-stamp of Town Hall. The appellants acknowledged their participation in the activities above described. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on (i) statements of witnesses and defendants, (ii) interception of communications, (iii) surveillance, searches and seizures. Legal findings:The Court of Nancy(France)convicted the defendant inter alia for migrant smuggling, specifically for procuring and or enabling - in the context of an organised criminal group - the illegal entry, transit and or stay of non EU citizens, in contradiction to EU and domestic law The Appeal Court of Nancy confirmed the decision.

"The appellant O.X. used his professional position in the préfecture of Guyane (France)  - where he dealt with requests for residence permits – to facilitate the fraudulent issuing of administrative documents necessary for foreigners to enter and stay in France. While O.X. did not have the power to decide on requests for residence permit, he manipulated and presented the files to his hierarchy fully aware of mis-representations therein. He acted in this manner for financial or other material gain. A review of his bank accounts revealed abnormal and unjustified operations, notably: 32 500 Euro in May 2007 and 43 700 in April 2007. The appellant tried to justify this income with his gambling endeavours. However, several inconsistencies in that respect remained. Upon searching his residence, authorities discovered several blank certificates of accommodation, a crucial document in the process of requesting a residence permit. Appellant O.X. denied all accusations though admitting to have changed the planning of work and accelerated the schedule of meetings, yet without receiving any gain in exchange.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on searches and seizures, documental and testimonial evidence.  Legal findings:The Court of Appeal of Cayennes (France)convicted the appellants of passive corruption and “assisting the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France”. On appeal, the Court of Cassation partially confirmed the decision. However, it overturned it in respect of the penalty applied.For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant admitted to have issued certificates of residence in France to several irregular migrants, allegedly without having perceived any financial or other material benefit. He acknowledged to have the same stated “legal residence” as an irregular migrant he assisted but was, nonetheless, unable to provide any information regarding the latter.Upon a search to the defendant’s residence, authorities found his associate (M.Y.) as well as seven irregular migrants in situ. The electricity contract of the apartment was under the defendant’s name. During questioning, M.Y. was unable to explain the provenance of 6000 Euro found in his possession, simply stating the cash had been lent to him by friends so as to enable the purchase of a real estate. In ascertaining the facts, authorities took into account inter alia testimonial evidence and the outcome search and seizure operations. Legal findings:The competent Investigative Judge deemed there to be sufficient evidence to hold the defendant and his associate prima facie responsible for “assisting the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France”. Accordingly, it referred the case to the tribunal correctionnel. The defendant contested this decision.

"Throughout 2008, 2009 and 2010, in French territory, the defendants (W.A.T. and B.E.F.) assisted foreign nationals (at least 13) to irregularly enter, transit or stay in France, notably by: (i) falsifying and using false administrative documents, (ii) being in possession of false administrative documents, (iii) obtaining false documents. The offences were committed through an organised criminal group.  On 6 July 2009, the Sub-Directorate on the Fight against Irregular Migration and the Illegal Work of Foreigners (Sous-direction de la Lutte de l’immigration irrégulière et le travail illégale des étrangers) received an anonymous tip on the existence of a network of irregular migration. Defendant W.A.T. would be involved in it by ensuring the trip and arrival in France of migrants original from Mauritania, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Morocco, some of whom would be minors. As a result, authorities placed the residence of W.A.T. and himself under surveillance. On 9 July 2012, he was observed picking up two seemingly African individuals from the station of Austerlitz (Paris, France), who were arriving from Cerbère (France). The analysis of the data collected through the bugging of his mobile phones, revealed that (i) W.A.T. was often in contact with Morocco, (ii) migrants paid between 2500 and 3000 Euro per person. W.A.T.’s phone number often activated towers in airports Rossy Charles de Gaule and d’Orly (both in France). In August 2009, W.A.T. carried out several return trips between Spain and Morocco.The analysis of his computer data (which had also been bugged), provided evidence on the organisation of trips, recruitment of migrants, and methods used to obtain false documents. Authorities retrieved photographs in passport format, copies of passports, plane tickets reservations. In several emails, W.A.T. acknowledged and confirmed the arrival of several migrants in France, sometimes via Morocco.Electronic surveillance techniques permitted identifying several accomplices/members of the organised criminal group operating: (i) in France (five individual including the defendant B.E.F.) and abroad (four individuals, residing in the United Kingdom and Morocco).From December 2009 on, W.A.T. extended his migrant smuggling activities to Greece’s route. In this context, another accomplice, resident in Belgium, was identified. Physical and electronic surveillance confirmed these developments and attested to the arrival of at least two irregular migrants, via Greece. Conversations involving W.A.T. and his accomplices referred to “app. 20 migrants in Greece waiting for their trip to France”.Under questioning, W.A.T. declared inter alia that new arrivals in Morocco would receive a three months valid stamp on their passport. W.A.T. thus proposed to migrants the stamping of their passports in the terms explained, in exchange of 800 Euro. He declared to authorities that he would receive the payment and disappear before concluding any border crossing. Investigations revealed close connections with a police officer in Morocco. W.A.T. also admitted some involvement in the migrant smuggling venture via Greece. He denied additional criminal facts. B.E.F. was heard on the facts. He declared to be a child friend of W.A.T. He denied being involved in smuggling ventures, though W.A.T. would “have something to do with it”. B.E.F. admitted to facts attested by surveillance techniques, notably having supplied stolen passports and third parties’ passports to W.A.T. He later retracted some of these admissions. His involvement in the activities of the organised criminal group was supported by the declarations of other members thereof. In ascertaining the facts, authorities resorted to electronic surveillance (including interception of communications, computer bugging), searches and seizures, physical surveillance operations, declarations of defendants and witnesses. Legal findings:The defendants were charged by the Prosecution with  “assisting, though an organised criminal group, the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State Party to the Schengen Agreement”.

"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.T.P.) against his conviction for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The appellant was charged with arranging “approximately 30 marriages” with the purpose of obtaining or facilitating the issuance of residence permits in France or the acquisition of French nationality, during the period of 1 January 2002 to 31 January 2007. However, the accusation and appealed sentence refer in detail to 10 marriages from 21 August 2002 to 4 May 2004.The recruitment of French nationals to marry Cameroonian citizens took place in France while the marriages were celebrated in Denmark since the latter’s legislation did not require the presence of the spouses earlier than the day before the wedding.  The recruited brides were paid between 2000 and 4500 Euro. The marriages were organised via the intermediation of an enterprise based in Germany, which, in 2002-2004, perceived a significant increase of marriages between French and Cameroonians. The enterprise charged a fee of 350 Euro per wedding. Its owners declared that the appellant referred to them 1-2 couples per month, for which he received a fee of 50 Euro per marriage.It was ascertained this scheme operated through a number of intermediaries, who recruited the French nationals and transported them to Denmark, to celebrate the wedding, and then back to France. Sometimes they went to Germany to address organisational issues. Their expenses in the course of these events were covered. The appellant was identified as “le Président” of this organisational scheme. Some witnesses indicated the appellant was present in preparatory meetings of the fraudulent marriages and directly engaged in the arrangement thereof. The wife of the appellant declared to have recruited six women on behalf of the defendant to marry African individuals based in Europe. She estimated her husband organised two to five marriages per month (108 to 270 marriages from August 2002 to December 2006). The appellant himself declared to organise such marriages – “approximately 30 from 2002 on – demanding 4000 Euro to the African spouse-to-be. From this amount, 3000 Euro would be for the woman to marry, 500 Euro for the recruiter and 500 Euro for himself. He also acknowledged to have acted as intermediary to the Germany-based enterprise specialised in planning weddings. He continued these activities until the moment of his detention. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on statements of witnesses, individuals who contracted sham marriages, intermediaries in the criminal plan, the defendant. Telephone surveillance techniques were also used. Legal findings:The Court of Rennes(France)convicted the defendant for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The Appeal Court of Rennes overturned the decision and ordered the release of the defendant. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The decision rules on the appeal lodged by two individuals against their conviction inter alia for “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner original from other State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The appellants were deemed members of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. Between 2009 and 26 April 2011, the appellants assisted foreigners to irregularly obtain a residence permit in Spain, by presenting false marriage certificates. They recruited French women willing to go through with the scam, accompanied the Tunisian migrants to Spain, and obtained the necessary fraudulent documents.The “wife” firstly enrolled in the registry of foreigners in Spain. The “husband” would later address the same services and request, on the basis of a false marriage certificate, the issuance of a Spanish residence permit. Legal findings:La Juridiction inter-régionale spécialisée de Bordeauxconvicted the defendants of “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court of Appeal of Bordeaux confirmed the appealed decision but increased the length of the penalty of interdiction from the French territory.For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant – a priest – provided accommodation to irregular migrants in the Parish Centre of Montreynaud (France), property of the diocesan association, the president of which was the Bishop of Saint Etienne (France).He was accused of having breached the municipal regulation of 4 February 2013 that determined the closure of the establishment in question. It was argued against the defendant that the Parish Centre did not fully comply with regulations on public safety and sanitation. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, including from the defendant. Legal findings:The Prosecution demanded a fine of 12 000 Euro. It was argued that the “accommodation policy” favoured by the defendant was an incentive to irregular migration. The Court of First Instance of Saint Étienne acquitted the defendant. For further details see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. Note: The case against the defendant was not pursued on grounds of migrant smuggling.

"Date(s) of offending: On/from throughout 2011 to 22 November 2011In February 2011, the German police informed OCRIEST (Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d' étrangers sans titre) of the existence of a Vietnamese organized criminal group primordially based and managed in France dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The defendants were accused of membership in the said organized criminal group, the function of which was to ensure the illegal entry of migrants into the United Kingdom, either via transportation arranged by the criminal network or through the so-called “éco”, “Co”, or“Herbe” method, that is, hiding in lorries without the knowledge of the drivers.Specifically, throughout 2011 and until 22 November of the same year, the defendants operated in the regions of Île de France (France) and Nord Pas de Calais (France). They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0

"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",trafficking in persons,1

Y. worked for the couple of defendants for 150 Euro per month, which A. automatically transferred to Y’s aunt in Senegal. Y. never perceived any remuneration for her work. The defendants did not make the necessary declarations to social security. Y. slept and ate at the defendants residence.

Conversations involving W.A.T. and his accomplices referred to “app. 20 migrants in Greece waiting for their trip to France”.Under questioning, W.A.T. declared inter alia that new arrivals in Morocco would receive a three months valid stamp on their passport. W.A.T. thus proposed to migrants the stamping of their passports in the terms explained, in exchange of 800 Euro. He declared to authorities that he would receive the payment and disappear before concluding any border crossing. Investigations revealed close connections with a police officer in Morocco. W.A.T. also admitted some involvement in the migrant smuggling venture via Greece. He denied additional criminal facts. B.E.F. was heard on the facts. He declared to be a child friend of W.A.T. He denied being involved in smuggling ventures, though W.A.T. would “have something to do with it”. B.E.F. admitted to facts attested by surveillance techniques, notably having supplied stolen passports and third parties’ passports to W.A.T. He later retracted some of these admissions. His involvement in the activities of the organised criminal group was supported by the declarations of other members thereof. In ascertaining the facts, authorities resorted to electronic surveillance (including interception of communications, computer bugging), searches and seizures, physical surveillance operations, declarations of defendants and witnesses. Legal findings:The defendants were charged by the Prosecution with  “assisting, though an organised criminal group, the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State Party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court convicted the defendants. B.E.F. was acquitted for events prior to 31 August 2009.For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.T.P.) against his conviction for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The appellant was charged with arranging “approximately 30 marriages” with the purpose of obtaining or facilitating the issuance of residence permits in France or the acquisition of French nationality, during the period of 1 January 2002 to 31 January 2007. However, the accusation and appealed sentence refer in detail to 10 marriages from 21 August 2002 to 4 May 2004.The recruitment of French nationals to marry Cameroonian citizens took place in France while the marriages were celebrated in Denmark since the latter’s legislation did not require the presence of the spouses earlier than the day before the wedding.  The recruited brides were paid between 2000 and 4500 Euro. The marriages were organised via the intermediation of an enterprise based in Germany, which, in 2002-2004, perceived a significant increase of marriages between French and Cameroonians. The enterprise charged a fee of 350 Euro per wedding. Its owners declared that the appellant referred to them 1-2 couples per month, for which he received a fee of 50 Euro per marriage.It was ascertained this scheme operated through a number of intermediaries, who recruited the French nationals and transported them to Denmark, to celebrate the wedding, and then back to France. Sometimes they went to Germany to address organisational issues. Their expenses in the course of these events were covered. The appellant was identified as “le Président” of this organisational scheme. Some witnesses indicated the appellant was present in preparatory meetings of the fraudulent marriages and directly engaged in the arrangement thereof. The wife of the appellant declared to have recruited six women on behalf of the defendant to marry African individuals based in Europe. She estimated her husband organised two to five marriages per month (108 to 270 marriages from August 2002 to December 2006). The appellant himself declared to organise such marriages – “approximately 30 from 2002 on – demanding 4000 Euro to the African spouse-to-be. From this amount, 3000 Euro would be for the woman to marry, 500 Euro for the recruiter and 500 Euro for himself. He also acknowledged to have acted as intermediary to the Germany-based enterprise specialised in planning weddings. He continued these activities until the moment of his detention. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on statements of witnesses, individuals who contracted sham marriages, intermediaries in the criminal plan, the defendant. Telephone surveillance techniques were also used. Legal findings:The Court of Rennes(France)convicted the defendant for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The Appeal Court of Rennes overturned the decision and ordered the release of the defendant. For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The decision rules on the appeal lodged by two individuals against their conviction inter alia for “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner original from other State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The appellants were deemed members of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. Between 2009 and 26 April 2011, the appellants assisted foreigners to irregularly obtain a residence permit in Spain, by presenting false marriage certificates. They recruited French women willing to go through with the scam, accompanied the Tunisian migrants to Spain, and obtained the necessary fraudulent documents.The “wife” firstly enrolled in the registry of foreigners in Spain. The “husband” would later address the same services and request, on the basis of a false marriage certificate, the issuance of a Spanish residence permit. Legal findings:La Juridiction inter-régionale spécialisée de Bordeauxconvicted the defendants of “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court of Appeal of Bordeaux confirmed the appealed decision but increased the length of the penalty of interdiction from the French territory.For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"Date(s) of offending: On/from throughout 2011 to 22 November 2011In February 2011, the German police informed OCRIEST (Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d' étrangers sans titre) of the existence of a Vietnamese organized criminal group primordially based and managed in France dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The defendants were accused of membership in the said organized criminal group, the function of which was to ensure the illegal entry of migrants into the United Kingdom, either via transportation arranged by the criminal network or through the so-called “éco”, “Co”, or“Herbe” method, that is, hiding in lorries without the knowledge of the drivers.Specifically, throughout 2011 and until 22 November of the same year, the defendants operated in the regions of Île de France (France) and Nord Pas de Calais (France). They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"The defendant was accused of having facilitated, on 2 April 2008, in Perpignan (France), the irregular entry, transit and stay of a foreign national into France.

"The defendant (Binh Thanh Le), a vendor on the darknet Wall Street Market (“Eastsidehigh”), and his two co-conspirators (Steven McCall and Allante Pires), were charged “with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with the intent to distribute” drugs, such as MDMA and ketamine, in violation of U.S. law. The defendant’s operations were revealed pursuant to U.S. postal service and other law enforcement investigations. The defendant received wholesale drugs and related raw materials, processed these drugs and/or manufactured drugs based on raw materials, and shipped them to buyers by postal service.  A search of the defendant’s home revealed packages with vacuum sealed bags containing drugs that had been purposely mislabeled (“Lego box for kids”). Border security agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection also intercepted packages from the defendant and co-conspirators, which contained illicit drugs. The defendant “pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute” drugs and was required to forfeit over 59 bitcoin, USD 114,680, the proceeds from the sale of his vehicle, his currency counter, and pill press. For his crime, he received eight years’ imprisonment, followed by 3 years supervision upon release from prison.",cybercrime,0
"This case concerns the defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitated computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes, and money laundering. The defendant was a Nigerian national and resident of the United Arab Emirates at the time of offending.From January 2019 to June 2020, the defendant conspired with multiple other persons to conduct financial transactions into, within, and outside the United States involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud. The co-conspirators targeted multiple victims and laundered and/or attempted to launder funds fraudulently obtained, as well as attempted to fraudulently obtain funds, through bank cyber-heists, business email compromise (“BEC”) frauds, and other fraud schemes. In December 2019, the defendant began conspiring with a co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator A”) to defraud a businessperson, who was seeking a lender to invest USD 15,000,000 in a project to build an international school. The defendant began communicating with the businessperson using an alias and promised to assist in opening a bank account in the United States, where the loan could be deposited. The defendant arranged for another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator B”) to open a bank account at Wells Fargo Bank in Canoga Park, California in the name of a Qatari company, and file a fictitious business name statement in order to register a fictitious business entity. Subsequently, the defendant directed a co-conspirator in Nigeria (“Co-conspirator C”) to create a false and fraudulent power of attorney bearing the name of the Qatari company.  The defendant then forwarded the bank information and power of attorney to the businessperson. The defendant and Co-Conspirator A each corresponded with the businessperson to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay approximately USD 330,000 to fund the opening of a purported “investor’s account” in order to facilitate the transfer of the USD 15,000,000 loan they promised the businessperson. The defendant himself directed the businessperson to make wire transfers of USD 230,000 to the Wells Fargo bank account of a luxury watch-seller and USD 100,000 to a Capital One bank account of another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator D”), which the businessperson did.The defendant used these funds for his personal benefit, and none of the funds were used as promised to the businessperson. The defendant used the wire transfer of USD 230,000 to purchase a luxury Richard Mille RM11-03 watch and arranged for the watch-seller to have the watch available in the New York metropolitan area, where Co-conspirator D picked it up.  Co-conspirator D and another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator E”) arranged to have the watch delivered to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator F”), who was directed by the defendant to transport the watch to the United Arab Emirates in January 2020.The defendant further directed Co-conspirator D to withdraw the USD 100,000 transferred to her and convert a portion of them - minus USD 8,000 as payment for Co-conspirator D – to the Nigerian currency, which she would then send to co-conspirators who would deliver the funds to the defendant using transfers between Nigerian bank accounts. The defendant also arranged to have Co-conspirator D send cashier’s checks of USD 40,000 and USD 10,000 to another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator G”) who would use the funds to obtain St. Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis’ citizenship and a passport for the defendant, which he received in February 2020.In January and February 2020, the defendant and Co-conspirator A corresponded with the businessperson, attempting to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay USD 575,000 in purported “taxes” to release the loan. In February, the businessperson wire transferred approximately USD 300,000 to bank accounts in Kenya.In the beginning of March 2020, the defendant further fraudulently induced the businessperson to send additional wire transfers to U.S. bank accounts, namely USD 100,000 to Co-conspirator D and USD 80,000 to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator H”). The funds from these payments were subsequently laundered through a variety of means, with the assistance of Co-conspirators D, E, G, and H.The defendant later admitted to the following approximate actual or intended loss amounts, foreseeable to him, in connection with the victims identified:- Foreign Financial Institution: approximately USD 14,700,000.00; - Victim Companies in the U.K.: approximately USD 7,740,000.00;  - Victim Law Firm: USD 922,857.76;  - and Victim Businessperson and Qatari Victim Company: USD 809,983.58.The defendant was arrested by U.A.E. law enforcement officials in June 2020. After his expulsion from the U.A.E., FBI special agents obtained custody of Abbas and brought him to the United States to stand trial.In April 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering. He was sentenced to over eleven years in prison and ordered to pay USD 1,732,841 in restitution to two fraud victims in November 2022.",cybercrime,1
"The defendant, Ruben Andre Garcia, engaged in coercion, force, and fraud to cause women to engage in commercial sex acts. Specifically, between 2013 and 2019, he recruited young women to participate in commercial sex act videos, which were later posted on pornography websites, GirlsDoPorn (GDP), GirlsDoToys (GDT), and PornHub, without the women’s consent. He duped the women by making false representations that the videos would not be posted online, made available in the U.S., or be seen by anyone the women knew.Several other co-conspirators (Michael James Pratt, Matthew Isaac Wolfe, Theodore Wilfred Gyi, Valorie Moser, and others) participated in the sex trafficking conspiracy. The defendant, and a co-conspirator (Pratt), also a recruiter, posted fake advertisements online on Craigslist (an online classified advertisement website) for modeling jobs. To convince the victims responding to the advertisements to participate in the filming of pornographic videos, the defendant, Pratt and other co-conspirators had other women, who were paid a fee for recruitment efforts and each time a victim agreed to be filmed, contact victims to assure them that the videos would not be made available online, in the U.S., or to anyone they know. Victims complained about painful sex acts requesting that filming stop, to no avail, and were frequently threatened with lawsuits and the posting of their videos online, the cancelation of tickets for their flights home, and the blocking of the victims’ exit from the hotel rooms with equipment where they were filming the videos to make the women feel that they could not leave.The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion” and “sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.” For his crimes, the defendant received 240 months’ imprisonment.Two of the defendant’s co-conspirators (Gyi and Moser) each pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion”. Another co-conspirator (Amberlyn Dee Nored) had the charges against her dismissed, another is currently a fugitive (Pratt), and the other (Wolfe) is still awaiting trial.",cybercrime,0
"The defendant (Maksim Berezan), a Latvian national, was a member of an exclusive website (“DirectConnection”) for cybercriminals engaging in cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. To become of a member of the site, prospective users had to have three existing DirectConnection members vouch for them and had to provide information about their prior criminal history and reputation.  The existing DirectConnection members who would vouch for the prospective member would have to pay a fee as “insurance” to existing members in the event that the new member did not follow through with agreements with other members.   DirectConnection had forums with threads dedicated to specific issues of interest to members. The site also enabled users to send private messages through the site. Members also communicated off the site through Jabber and ICQ. DirectConnection had administrators, moderators, and arbiters to adjudicate disputes pursuant to the site’s dispute resolution mechanism. The defendant engaged in carding on DirectConnection, specializing in “cashouts” (i.e., the use of stolen card data and PINs to steal money from accounts or use the data to make fraudulent purchases) and “drops” (i.e., a who person receives, or forwards fraudulently obtained goods or money or a location where fraudulently obtained goods or money is dropped off). Electronic evidence in this case revealed that the defendant engaged in ransomware activities as well.The defendant was arrested in Latvia and extradited from Latvia to the United States of America to be prosecuted for his cybercrimes. The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349” and “conspiracy to commit access device fraud and computer intrusions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371”.

"Maksym Nienadov, a Ukrainian citizen, set up a company called Healthy Nation through which he manufactured and sold counterfeit medicine from at least July 2018 up to January 2019. As the business grew, he was joined by Volodymyr Nikolaienko.In June 2018, undercover U.S. authorities began communicating with Nienadov about the illegal sale of Keytruda on WhatsApp. A months-long exchange, which also involved Nikolaienko and resulted in the unlawful sale of counterfeit or unapproved Keytruda, Abraxane and Epclusa (Cancer and Hepatitis B drugs), followed. For the wire transfer, law enforcement received Nienadov’s banking information, which included the name “Maksim Nenadov” and his Ukrainian bank account number. After several transactions and the analysis of the counterfeit drugs by the registered trademark holders, undercover law enforcement invited the two defendants to Texas to discuss further business deals. Upon their arrival in Texas, US, the defendants were arrested and taken into custody on 18 April 2019.Neither Nienadov nor Nikolaienko were medical doctors, pharmacists or licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States and they did not have authorisation to fabricate nor to sell the drugs.The defendants were charged with conspiracy, misbranded drugs, counterfeit drugs, trafficking in counterfeit drugs, and smuggling goods into the US.",cybercrime,1
"The leader (C.H.-M.) and two other high-ranking members (M.J.R. and S.A.S.) of a transnational criminal organization engaged in migrant smuggling operations in Tecate, Mexico. They were charged with various violations of Title 8, section 1324, of the United States Code, including alien smuggling, conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States for financial gain, and conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens within the United States for financial gain. The organization had illegally smuggled migrants from Mexico through the southern border of California for a fee of US$ 8,000 per person. M.J.R. and S.A.S had arranged meetings at hotels and motels to obtain the fees. Arrangements had subsequently been made to send the fees to C.H.-M. in Mexico.ICT played an integral role in the logistics of the migrant smuggling operations. In particular, the leader, higher-ranking members and associates of the criminal organization used a well-known messaging application to communicate and coordinate with each other before and during smuggling operations. M.J.R. and other criminal associates were responsible for recruiting drivers for the smuggling operations. Drivers were recruited through employment advertisements on an online classified advertisement site and other websites. Among those recruited were secondary school students from San Diego, California. C.H.-M. also used ICT to monitor and track movements of operatives and migrants, as well as to inform drivers of the pick-up locations for migrants by using a well-known mapping and navigation application for mobile devices.",cybercrime,1
"This case regards the defendant’s involvement in a computer-based intrusion fraud scheme. A chief financial officer of one company, namely Unatrac Holding Limited, received an email that purportedly contained a web link to the Microsoft Office 365 login page. The victim, having an email account with this host, trusted the link and viewed it as legitimate. After clicking on the link he received in the phishing email, the page he was sent to resembled the Microsoft Office 365 login page. For this reason, the chief financial officer input his login credentials, which unbeknownst to him, were captured by criminals, including the defendant, who then used this information to access his account. His email account was then used to send fraudulent emails requesting wire transfers from other members of the company’s financial team. What is more, having observed company policy and the internal practice of forwarding emails from vendors, the perpetrator forwarded a fictitious email he had created to make it look as if a vendor was sending an invoice. Ultimately, this fraudulent scheme resulted in approximately USD 11,000,000 of wire transfers sent to the defendant and his co-conspirators.On 2 August 2019, a criminal complaint was filed against the defendant accusing him of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

"This case involves a member of the cyber organized criminal group “The Dark Overlord” (TDO), an organization that was known for their ransom and extortion scams. Beginning in 2016, the defendant was involved in a conspiracy that encompassed hacking several organizations in health, entertainment, finance, commercial, real estate, and transportation, stealing personal information from the systems they hacked, including for instance medical records, and then seeking ransom from the targets. Companies would usually have to pay a ransom of between USED 75,000 and 350,000 in bitcoin.

"This case involved Bryan Connor Herrell, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in moderating thousands of illegal transactions under various monikers, including “Penissmith” and “Botah.” From 2016 through July 2017 AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017 it hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.The defendant Herrell and other co-conspirators (both known and unknown to the Grand Jury) were members and associates of AlphaBay. The marketplace operated as criminal enterprise with “employees” serving as security administrators, moderators, public relations specialists, and scam watchers (whose primary duty is to identify and remove fraudulent listings), meaning that leaders, members, and associates of AlphaBay had defined roles in the organization. The defendant in this case held the position of moderator from about May 2016 through July 2017. As moderator, Herrell had access to portions of the AlphaBay platform that were not available to the general public and had the authority to refund payments from buyers on the website, restore a user’s access to the site, engage in staff-only discussions and meetings, and view the amount of digital currency available to other members of the AlphaBay organization. Moderators also held the responsibility of moderating disputes between buyers and vendors on AlphaBay. For his work as a moderator, Herrell was paid four bitcoins per week (bitcoin was worth about USD 2,000 per coin in May 2016, and about USD 2,600 in July 2017). Through moderating disputes, the defendant Herrell had full visibility and awareness of the criminal activities occurring on AlphaBay and therefore held a role in directly facilitating these criminal activities. In addition, Herrell also held the position of scam watcher from around August 2015 to December 2015, where he monitored and quashed phishing attempts and other scams being carried out on AlphaBay. Herrell was also paid in bitcoin for this work.In 2017, Bryan Connor Herrell was indicted on the felony crime of Conspiracy to Engage in Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, USD 250,000 criminal fine, and up to 3 years supervised release. Additionally, upon conviction of this offence, Herrell also was subject to a forfeiture of property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1963(a)(1) - (a)(3).

"This case involves the sentencing of a Russian national who operated two websites facilitating payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other crimes.According to the official documents, the defendant, Aleksei Burkov, operated a website called “Card Planet,” which offered stolen credit card data that had been obtained mostly through computer intrusion. There were hundreds of thousands of victims, many of them U.S. citizens. Over 150,000 stolen credit card numbers from over 1,300 banks were offered for purchase. Regarding cards of U.S. accounts alone, this resulted in over USD 20 million in fraudulent purchases.In addition, the defendant operated another website, which was invite-only, where elite cybercriminals could advertise stolen goods (i.e. personal identification data), malicious software, and criminal services, including money laundering and hacking services. To obtain membership, prospective members needed three existing members to “vouch” for them and pay a sum of money, usually USD 5,000, as insurance. These measures were aimed at avoid detection from law enforcement authorities as well as guaranteeing that their members valued the deals made on the website. To the same end, the forum removed arrested members from the site by banning them to prevent law enforcement agencies from using the arrested member and/or arrested member’s details to access the site.The defendant was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, in December 2015. On 4 February 2016, the defendant was charged with conspiring to commit access device fraud (included in two counts), identity theft, computer intrusion, wire fraud (included in two counts), and money laundering, as well as with access device fraud and wire fraud in a superseding indictment. In 2017, an Israeli district court approved the extradition of the defendant to the United States. After the denial of the defendant’s appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High Court of Justice, the defendant was finally extradited on 11 November 2019. On 23 January 2020, The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft, computer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering on 23 January 2020. The judge sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment on 26 June 2020.",cybercrime,1
"This case involves several offences, including conspiracy, smuggling cultural property into the U.S., obstruction of justice, and citizenship and naturalization fraud, committed by the defendant Ijaz Khan with the assistance of several co-conspirators. In 2002, the co-conspirator Vera Lautt travelled to Pakistan to meet Ijaz Khan, whom she had met online, and to sign marriage documents. Subsequently, they both submitted fraudulent documents to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), facilitating the immigration and later naturalization of Ijaz Khan. The defendant Ijaz Khan was, however, still married to a Pakistani woman, with whom he had and continued to have children, at the time of and after signing the marriage documents. According to the indictment, Ijaz Khan used his citizenship to enable the immigration and later naturalization of his four oldest sons. He divorced Lautt before the children had arrived in the United States. He further filed or assisted with petitions on behalf of his brother, Ibar Khan, his Pakistani wife, his mother, and another two children.Following his immigration from approximately 2007 until May 2014, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with others, conspired to smuggle cultural artifacts (e.g., coins, pottery, arrowheads and bronze weapons) that were stolen from burial sites from Pakistan into the United States. The defendant used his company, Indus Valley, to sell the stolen cultural artifacts to his existing customer base, in person at shows, and online (on websites and auction sites, like eBay).In October 2013, a shipment was inspected and seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Subsequently, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with their co-conspirator John Bryan McNamara, conspired to submit fraudulent documents purporting to be from the Pakistan government authorizing his export of the cultural artifacts and certifying the value of objects. McNamara had previously pleaded guilty to smuggling the artifacts into the U.S. and making false statements to special agents when interrogated about this shipment.The defendant was identified as the leader and organizer of an organized criminal group made up of family members (e.g., wife and sons) and others who were not related to the defendant (e.g., McNamara). He played a central role in planning and operations, recruitment of accomplices, and controlled and exercised authority over others in the group. Because of his central leadership role, he received a sentencing enhancement, which he unsuccessfully appealed. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, a fine of approximately USD 115,000, and was required to forfeit more than 1,300 cultural artifacts. The defendant unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Others in the organized criminal group pleaded guilty and were also sentenced for their roles in the conspiracy to commit smuggling, including Vera Lautt and John Bryan McNamara, who received four months’ imprisonment (and two years’ supervised release from prison) and two years of probation, respectively.",cybercrime,1
"A group of five defendants participated in a worldwide ponzi scheme, the BitClub Network, which defrauded cryptocurrency investors. The BitClub Network required membership fees, “solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of pooled investments in cryptocurrency mining,” and “rewarded existing investors for recruiting new investors.” The funds provided by investors were purportedly required to sustain the cryptocurrency mining pools by, for example, purchasing equipment and computing power. The profits made by investors supposedly depended on the success of the mining pool operations and the number of shares investors had in the mining pools. To lure investors, keep existing investors, and get investors to provide money, the defendants fraudulently represented earnings. The group fraudulently “obtained at least [USD]… 722 million from investors.” The BCN shares sold were not registered as “securities” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as required by law. Two of the five defendants pled guilty: Joseph Frank Abel pled guilty to “conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities” and Silviu Catalin Balaci to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to offer and sell unregistered securities.” At the time of writing, the remaining three defendants (Matthew Brent Goettsche, Russ Albert Medlin, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks) have not yet been tried.",cybercrime,0
"The organized criminal group involved in this case perpetrated several cybercrimes, one of which was online auction fraud. According to the indictment, this fraud was perpetrated by members of the group by posting “hundreds or thousands of listings for automobiles, motorcycles, and other high-priced goods on eBay and similar auction sites.” The images of the items being sold that were included in these postings were infected with malware (i.e., the Bayrob Trojan). When individuals clicked on the images of the items, their devices were infected with the malware, which was designed to redirect these individuals to webpages that looked identical to the legitimate websites of the auction sites. For example, their fake eBay pages included the trademark of the organization and had a similar layout, design, and style of the legitimate eBay webpages with an important key difference. The fake eBay webpages prompted users to pay for the auctioned items using something called an “eBay escrow agent,” which does not exist on the legitimate platform. This purported service claimed to hold the money of the buyer in escrow until the item was received and the buyer was satisfied with the condition of the item delivered before the buyer’s funds were released to the seller. The webpages also included a live chat function that supposedly enabled individuals to speak with customer service agents of eBay; of course, these were not real eBay customer service agents, they were members of the group. The victims of this online auction fraud never received the items they paid for and never received a refund for the money they paid for the non-delivered items.One of the defendants (T.D.) pled guilty to aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, and received 10 years imprisonment for his crimes. B.N. and R.M. were charged, convicted, and sentenced to 20 and 18 years’ imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, as well as conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks.",cybercrime,1
"Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator Brandon Arias used the moniker “The Drug Llama” on a vendor account on Dream Market (a Darknet site) to sell counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. Melissa Scanlan was responsible for sourcing the drugs that would be sold using via the vendor account, while Brandon Arias was responsible for receiving and fulfilling Darknet drug orders, as well as the management of the account. Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator received fentanyl and other narcotics from Mexico, predominantly from Fausto Ramirez and another (unnamed) member of the Mexican cartel. After Melissa Scanlan and Brandon Arias sold the drugs, they kept a portion of the proceeds and gave the remaining criminal proceeds to couriers (usually Norma Dominguez and April Kelly, both females). The couriers would transport the proceeds across U.S.-Mexican border and deliver them to Fausto Ramirez and another member of a Mexican cartel. In one year alone, an estimated 52,000 counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills were sold.Melissa Scanlan was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, misbranding of drugs, international money laundering conspiracy, and distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.Brandon Arias was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, and misbranding of drugs.

"This case involves Gary Davis, a member of the small administrative “staff” of the Darknet marketplace “Silk Road.” During its operation from 2011 until 2013, Silk Road was used to distribute illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds of these illicit transactions.From June to 2 October 2013, Davis, also known under his alias “Libertas,” worked as a site administrator on Silk Road. He was responsible for responding to customer support requests regarding the need for assistance with buyer or seller accounts, serving as an arbitrator by resolving disputes between drug dealers and their customers, and enforcing the rules for doing business on Silk Road, such as the rule against out of escrow sales. Davis was paid a weekly salary for his administrative services on the marketplace.Shortly after law enforcement authorities had shut down Silk Road in October 2013, its virtually identical successor, Silk Road 2.0, emerged. Davis also served as an administrator for the successor website from November to December 2013.The defendant, along with two of his co-conspirators, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy on 19 December 2013. Davis was arrested in Ireland in January 2014 and extradited to the United States in July 2018. Davis pleaded guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy on 5 October 2018 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on 25 July 2019. He was further ordered to forfeit USD 25,000. At the time of writing, no official information is available on the convictions of his co-defendants, Andrew Michael Jones and Peter Phillip Nash.",cybercrime,1
"The defendant, Mr Gary Davis (aka “Libertas”) worked for the Silk Road website from June 2013 until 2 October 2013 (when the website was shutdown).Silk Road was an online black market created by Mr Ross Ulbricht where a wide range of illegal goods and services could be bought and sold. The platform resembled other online market places in that it required a username and password to log in, offered users a “shopping cart”, and had other like features). A variety of illicit drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, and opioids were available for purchase on the website. The drugs purchased on Silk Road caused real harm—drugs purchased on Silk Road resulted in six deaths for overdose (though there is no suggestion that Mr Davis was responsible for any of these deaths). Counterfeit and fraudulent identity documents were also available for sale on the website—including, for instance, counterfeit US and foreign passports, US and foreign drivers’ licenses, and social security cards. Computer hacking tools and services were also available for purchase on Silk Road, including password hacking tools and services, Remote Access Tools (RAT) which allows users to obtain unauthorised remote access to a compromised computer, keyloggers which permit a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim into his or her computer and used to steal confidential information, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services which disable websites or other publicly available services on the Internet by using large networks of compromised computers to flood victim systems with malicious internet traffic. Finally, Silk Road offered money laundering services to its users, many of which were directly marketed to vendors who sold goods or services on the website. Money laundering services aimed at converting proceeds of illegal transactions (obtained in Bitcoin, the required means of payment on the Silk Road website) into other forms of currency. Vendors in this category offered, among other things, the sale of US currency, anonymous debit cards preloaded with currency and other prepaid payment systems, such as Moneypak cards.Silk Road was only accessible through the Tor network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed round the work and designed to conceal the true IP of the computers on the network and, thereby, the identities of users.The required and only payment system on Silk Road was Bitcoin—an entirely electronic currency, not issued by any bank or state, generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network, and operated through blockchain stored on the peer-to-peer network. On Silk Road, every user had one (or more) Silk Road Bitcoin address associated with their own Silk Road account. The Bitcoin address could be used by each user to deposit funds into their Silk Road account. These addresses were stored on “wallet” files maintained on computer servers controlled by Mr Ulbricht. To make purchases on the website, therefore, a user had to first obtain Bitcoin (for example, from a Bitcoin exchanger) and send these to a Bitcoin address associated with the user’s Silk Road account. Once the purchase took place, the funds were debited from the user’s Silk Road account and held in escrow in a wallet file maintained by Silk Road pending completion of the transaction. Once the transaction was completed the vendor’s Silk Road account would be credited with the payment minus the commission Silk Road took on the sale (8–15% of the transaction). The vendor would then withdraw the Bitcoins from his Silk Road account by transferring them to an outside Bitcoin address, such as the address of a Bitcoin exchanger who would cash out the Bitcoins for real currency. The vendors would also convert their Bitcoins into other currencies, by using money laundering services offered on the website.Silk Road would also use a so-called “tumbler” to hinder the tracking of individual transactions through the blockchain. In a nutshell, the “tumbler” would obscure any link between both the buyer’s and the vendor’s Bitcoin addresses. It would, therefore, make the use of blockchain to follow the money trail useless, even if both the vendor’s and buyer’s Bitcoin addresses were known.Mr Ulbricht ran the website with some support staff (they were four when Silk Road was shutdown by law enforcement on 2 October 2013), who were divided into forum moderators and site administrators. Forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to conduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and Mr Ulbricht. Site administrators were in charge of responding to customer support requests from Silk Road users who needed assistance with their buyer or seller accounts; investigating disputes that arose between vendors and buyers, including reporting their findings to Mr Andrew Michael Jones (another site administrator) or Mr Ulbricht; and helping enforce the rules for doing business on Silk Road. This last responsibility included demoting vendors or referring them to Mr Ulbricht for further discipline. This could happen when vendors and buyers would communicate on Silk Road and decide to conclude the sale offsite to avoid paying to Silk Road a commission (this was called “out of escrow” sales).Mr Gary Davis first worked for a month as a forum moderator of Silk Road. He then was “promoted” to site administrator. As a site administrator, he demoted an account that was likely compromised by the police and posted some posts on the forum advising users how to conceal their true identities. When Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement on 2 October 2013, Mr Davis helped with the launch of “Silk Road 2.0”, a website which was created in the month following Silk Road’s demise. Mr Davis used his credibility with the original Silk Road community to vouch for the new website. He worked on the new version of Silk Road as a site administrator for one month, until he was arrested in Ireland in January 2014.Mr Davis was extradited from Ireland to the US in July 2018. He pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to traffic a controlled substance (narcotics). He was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment on 25 July 2019.",cybercrime,1
"Between 2015 and 2017, the defendant Sergiy Petrovich Usatyuk and a co-conspirator deployed booter services for financial gain, allowing paying users to utilize their services to launch DDoS attacks. Specifically, the defendant and the co-conspirator developed software and created, controlled, and operated a website and infrastructure (e.g., domain names and servers in the U.S. and Romania) to enable paying users to deploy DDoS attacks. One of the most popular booter services used included ExoStresser. Other services offered included Betabooter, Databooter, DecafeStresser, Instabooter, IP Booters, IP Stressors, Polystress, QuezStresser, and Zstress. The booter services the defendant provided along with his co-conspirator were used to conduct 1,367,610 DDoS attacks against systems inside and outside of the United States. These DDoS attacks not only caused harm to the computer systems directly targeted, but also caused harm to computers systems not directly targeted by the attacks. The defendant and the co-conspirator also created and maintained the payment and cryptocurrency accounts needed to obtain the proceeds of crime. The defendant and co-conspirators further engaged in tactics to conceal their identities and activities. In 2019, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to cause damage to protected computers. That same year, the defendant was sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment and three years of supervised release following the completion of the sentence.

"This case involved a sextortion scheme perpetrated by inmates in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, as well as co-conspirators outside of the prison, against U.S. military personnel. In this sextortion scheme, the inmates, using smartphones they smuggled into the prison, signed up for dating apps and targeted U.S. military members utilizing these apps. The defendants and co-conspirators created fake profiles of women using images that they found online. After contacting the targets and obtaining personal information from them, the inmates would send naked images of the person they were impersonating (images which were also found online) and request that the targets provide nude images. The inmates would then call the targets impersonating the father of the person the targets were in contact with (i.e., the women in the profile). The inmates would proceed to misinform the targets that they were communicating with a minor and that what the targets had in their possession (i.e., the naked image) was considered child sexual abuse material. The inmates would then threaten to contact the authorities and report the individuals if money was not paid to the “victim”. The targets were directed to pay these fees using wire transfers via Western Union, MoneyGram, Walmart, and PayPal. The inmates recruited money mules, who received the wire transfers from the military members and would then send the funds to the inmates as directed.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering. Several of the defendants pled guilty. Specifically, Tiffany Reed pled guilty and was sentenced to three years’ probation for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another defendant, Wendell Wilkins, also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, but has yet to be sentenced. Jalisa Thompson, Brandon Thompson pled guilty to money laundering and were sentenced to time served and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively. The prosecution also submitted a motion to dismiss the indictment against one of the defendants, namely, Laben McCoy.

"This case involved Ronald L. Wheeler, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in, inter alia, moderating the AlphaBay subreddit, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, and mediating sales disputes, under the monikers “Trappy” and “Trappy_Pandora.” From 2016 through July 2017, AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017, hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website, as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.On 25 May 2015 at the latest, the defendant began working for AlphaBay as a public relations specialist. His duties included moderating the AlphaBay subreddit on the website reddit.com, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, mediating sales disputes among AlphaBay users, promoting AlphaBay online, and providing non-technical assistance to AlphaBay users. The defendant was paid in Bitcoin for his services. His work continued until the website was shut down.The defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit acces device fraud.

"This case involves a transnational criminal organization (called the “Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network” by U.S. authorities in the criminal indictment) which perpetrated online auction fraud (i.e., advertising and selling non-existent items) against U.S. victims on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and AutoTrader.com. The organization primarily operated in Alexandria, Romania, with some operations taking place in other areas of Eastern Europe, as well as the United States. The victims of the online auction fraud paid for the fake items with “reloadable prepaid cards, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards of varying types (collectively referred to herein as ‘prepaid debit cards’), including Green Dot Moneypaks, Visa One Vanilla prepaid debit cards, PayPal My Cash cards, and Amazon gift cards; United States postal money orders; cashier’s checks; MoneyGram and Western Union wires; and bank wires and deposits.”The Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network worked with others to launder criminal proceeds, by taking the money paid by victims for the fake items sold online, converting the money to Bitcoin, transferring the Bitcoin to members and associates in Eastern Europe, and using Bitcoin exchanges to convert the Bitcoin to fiat currency. Associates of the organizations in the United States, such as J.A.V., obtained victim payments, converted them to Bitcoins, and sent the Bitcoins to members of the organization who had perpetrated the online auction fraud. Third-party money launderers in the U.S. (i.e., A.E.N., D.A.B., and R.W.D.L.T) were also used to collect, redeem, and convert victim payment into cash or Bitcoins. Additionally, two Bitcoin exchangers were used by the Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network. Particularly, a Bulgarian national (Rossen Iossifov) owner of a Bitcoin exchange (RG Coins), registered in Bulgaria, was charged and convicted for conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit money laundering in contravention of U.S. laws.

"This case involves an international online child sexual exploitation ring, the Bored group, which met, organized its activities, and operated exclusively online. The Bored group earned this nickname because the chatrooms they created all included the word “bored” in them. Initially, the group met on Stickham, a social media platform which was popular for live streaming video chats. Frustrated with the moderation that existed on this site, they migrated to other sites and ultimately ended up using one unidentified site that was not moderated. The chatrooms they created on this site could not be found unless the person knew the URL of the chatroom.The perpetrators devised and executed a plan to lure targets from moderated platforms to an unmoderated chatroom-based forum and entice them to engage in sex acts. Specifically, the members of the group worked together to recruit, entice, and coerce minors to engage in sex acts during video-chat sessions. To accomplish this, members of the group created fake profiles of teenage boys on social media and dating sites, such as MYLOL.com, Periscope, YouNow, and Gifyo, to target minor girls. The members would then identify minors to target, contact, and communicate with in order to get the victims to join the offenders in unmonitored chatrooms. All of the members of the group spent a considerable amount of time communicating with their targets in order to gain their trust, build rapport with them, and ultimately, entice the victims to commit sex acts. Beyond communication, Bored group members used several techniques to manipulate victims, including:1. Dares. Daring minors to engage in sexualized behaviour and sex acts.2. Polls. Running polls with participants in the chat rooms about the attractiveness of minors and/or voting on what type of items of clothing the minor should remove and/or what type of sex act the minor should engage in.3. Competitions. Minors were pitted against each other in an effort to be rewarded (i.e., they would receive points for engaging in certain sexualized behaviour and sex acts, and advance levels based on points).4. Purporting to Block Cameras. To reduce the inhibitions of minors, members who victims trusted (called “handlers”) would claim that they could block the camera and prevent others in the chatroom from viewing the victims. When the handler told other group members that this tactic was used, the participants in the chatroom would pretend that they were unable to see the victim’s web camera.  5. Loops. Pre-recorded videos of minors talking and/or engaging in sexualized behaviour or sex acts.  These videos were played as if they were occurring in real-time in order to manipulate a minor into engaging in similar conduct and/or acts. The Bored group had distinct roles for members: hunters, talkers, and loopers. Hunters lured victims to the chatroom. Talkers handled the next phase, which involved convincing the minors to undress and masturbate on camera by engaging them in conversation and building trust and rapport. Loopers posed as a female minor and played a pre-recorded video of a previous victim talking or engaging in sex acts (but passed it off as if it was playing in real-time). Loopers played these pre-recorded videos in an effort to convince girls to perform a sex act.As a method to monitor, evaluate, and coordinate their activities, track progress, and share their knowledge and expertise, they would discuss their plans, activities, and experiences on a separate site (the now defunct Titan Pad) and record their activities and experiences on a password-protected spreadsheet on that site that included information about which chatrooms on the website were associated with which victims and the social media accounts associated with members that were used to lure each of the victims. The spreadsheet also enabled the members of the group to keep track of the manipulation techniques that were successful with each victim and what sex acts each victim engaged in (including extremely depraved acts; e.g., one member of the group enticed a minor to engage in a sex act with a dog). After Titan Pad ceased its operation in 2017, the Bored group moved its activities to Discord, a group chat platform, with voice and video capabilities.The defendant, Caleb Young, pled guilty to child exploitation enterprise and received 30 years’ imprisonment for his crime. Other members of the group were also charged and sentenced for their crimes. C.M., the leader of the child exploitation enterprise, received 40 years’ imprisonment for his crime. He was killed in prison during an altercation with other inmates in January 2019. Other members of the group received 38 years’ (A.S.), 37 years and 6 months’ (O.O.), 35 years’ (J.N.R.), 31 years and 3 months’ (M.F.), and 30 years and 6 months’ imprisonment (B.J.S. and D.W., each) for their crimes.

"This case involves the co-founders, administrators and members of the Infraud Organization, which was founded in 2010 and was active between 2010 and 2018. The slogan of the organization was “in fraud we trust.” The Infraud Organization operated as a criminal enterprise with its objective of financially enriching its members through cybercrimes, particularly online fraud and identity theft. The illicit acts the organization engaged in included money laundering, identity theft, counterfeit identification trafficking, bank fraud, wire fraud, among other crimes. In total, the organization caused USD 568 million in actual losses and USD 2.2 billion in intended losses. The Infraud Organization ran an online discussion forum, known as Infraud, which had over 10,000 members from around the world. According to the Second Superseding Criminal Indictment, the roles of individuals that were part of this criminal enterprise included administrators, super moderators, moderators, vendors, VIP members, and members:1. Administrators.  Administrators were responsible for “long-term strategic planning” of the enterprise, and daily management tasks, such as determining responsibilities and levels of access of all members, vetting prospective members, deciding which members can join, and rewarding and punishing existing members.2. Super Moderators. Super moderators were responsible for moderating content by reviewing contraband for sale, editing and deleting posts based on reviews, and mediating disputes between buyers and vendors (i.e., sellers). The content they moderated was assigned based on either geographic area or criminal expertise.3. Moderators. Moderators have some of the same responsibilities for moderating content, but they have less privileges and authority than super moderators. 4. Vendors. Individuals who sold and/or advertised illicit goods and services on the site.5. VIP members. VIP members were longstanding, distinguished members of the platform.6. Members.  General members of the forum.The founders of the organization are Svyatoslav Bondarenko and Sergey Medvedev. Along with being a co-founder, Sergey Medvedev served as the administrator of the site and ran the escrow service of the organization, which held funds for a purchase in escrow until the buyer received the items purchased (in good order). He further created a virtual currency exchange service where virtual currencies were exchanged for fiat currencies, promoted, created incentives, and set prices for advertisements on Infraud. The defendant assumed leadership of the organization after Svyatoslav Bondarenko disappeared.For quality control of contraband recovered from acts of fraud and identity theft, members provided feedback and ratings of vendors and their products. To protect individuals who are part of this criminal enterprise, measures were taken to secure the site and restrict access to the site. Svyatoslav Bondarenko established rules governing the conduct of members on Infraud and these rules were enforced by administrators, moderators, and supermoderators of the forum. Members who violated these rules were punished by, for example, being removed and banned from the site. All new members had to be vetted before being granted access to the forum.In this case, 36 defendants were charged for their roles in the Infraud Organization. The criminal proceedings for most of these defendants are still ongoing. The defendant, one of the founders of Infraud, Sergey Medvedev, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. The other founder, Svyatoslav Bondarenko, is still at large. Two other defendants and members of Infraud pleaded guilty to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. Firstly, Jose Gamboa became a member of Infraud in December 2010 and advertised as vendor of custom-built ATM skimmers within the Infraud forum. Secondly, Valerian Chiochiu advised other members on the development and use of malware. He also developed malware that was used by other members to gain unauthorized access to personal and financial data and access device data. The illegally obtained information would then be sold on the Infraud forum to other Infraud members. The defendant also fraudulently purchased gift cards which were then sold on the Infraud forum to members for a profit.",cybercrime,0
"In or around July 2014, ALEXANDRE CAZES, aka ""ALPHA02,"" aka ""ADMIN,"" with· other persons, known and unknown to the. Grand Jury, created AlphaBay (also referred to as the ""AlphaBay Market""), a dark-web marketplace designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. The site also enabled users to purchase and sell illegal services, including “tumbling” and “mixing” services, which are forms of money laundering used for digital currencies.From its official launch in December 2014 AlphaBay was used by thousands of vendors to distribute controlled substances and other illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these illegal transactions. AlphaBay also provided a private, internal messaging service through which staff, vendors, and buyers could communicate, as well as an associated web forum called the ""AlphaBay Market Forum."" On 1 June 2017, an arrest warrant would be issued for Alexandre CAZES that would be satisfied approximately one month later on 5 July 2017. CAZES was arrested during a raid on his home in Bangkok, Thailand and was held by the Royal Thai Police for approximately seven days before apparently committing suicide while in custody on 12 July 2017. On 19 July 2017 U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of California filed a civil forfeiture complaint against CAZES and his wife.",cybercrime,0
"This case involves several cyber and organized crime related offences of the creator of Silk Road, a massive online marketplace which sold illicit goods and services, in particular drugs. The defendant, Ross William Ulbricht, created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013.The defendant deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace with the intent to facilitate its users to buy and sell illegal goods and services anonymously and under the radar of law enforcement. The defendant aimed at anonymizing transactions on Silk Road by operating Silk Road on “The Onion Router,” or “Tor” network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed around the world, designed to conceal the true IP addresses, and hence identities of its users; and by including a Bitcoin-based payment system that concealed the identities and locations of the users.The defendant controlled and oversaw every aspect of Silk Road, and managed a staff of paid, online administrators and computer programmers who assisted with the day-to-day operation of the site.  The defendant reaped commissions worth over USD 13 million generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.The U.S. government learned of Silk Road in 2011, after intercepting a drug package in Chicago's O'Hare airport, and commenced an investigation into the online marketplace. Agents discovered that the Silk Road was run and managed by someone with the screen name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” (D.P.R.). In 2012, law enforcement agents investigated several individuals believed to be “Dread Pirate Roberts,” including Ross Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, Ulbricht became the primary suspect in 2013 after a series of “pen/trap” orders, which led U.S. law enforcement agents to collect evidence in the form of I.P. address data from Ulbricht’s home wireless network. Additional evidence came from undercover investigations, in which law enforcement agents took over low-level Silk Road administrators’ accounts and interacted with D.P.R. online, in an attempt to expose Ulbricht. In October 2013, at the San Francisco public library, agents arrested Ulbricht after catching him while he was logged in as the administrator of Silk Road and its D.P.R.The defendant was charged with and convicted of distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering. He was further accused of soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there was no evidence that these murders were actually carried out.",cybercrime,1
"The defendant, Mr Steven W Chase, founded—and, between 19 August 2014 and 4 March 2015, was the lead administrator of—a website called ‘Playpen’ dedicated to the exchange of child pornography. The site enabled users to chat, exchange, and purchase images of child sexual abuse content in an anonymous way.The site had more than 150,000 users from around the world and was believed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be the world’s largest child pornography website. The content of the website was divided into different ‘boards’ categorised according to the age and sex of the victims and the type of sexual activity involved.Following a slip up by Chase in December 2014, Playpen’s unique IP address was exposed to a foreign law enforcement agency. The IP address was revealed to be in the US, and the law enforcement agency notified the FBI.In January 2015 the FBI, in partnership with the US Department of Justice’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, launched ‘Operation Pacifier’, which sought to identify the members of the Playpen website and bring them to justice.On 19 February 2015, the FBI executed a search warrant of Mr Chase’s home and Mr Chase was arrested. Forensic examination of a computer and devices seized during the search found thousands of images of child exploitation material.On 16 September 2016, a federal jury found Mr Chase of multiple charges relating to child pornography and child exploitation. On 1 May 2017 he was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment for these offences.Two other men, Messrs Michael Fluckiger, 46, of Indiana, United States of America, and David Browning, 47, of Kentucky, United States of America, also acted as administrators of the Playpen website. They were each sentenced to 20-year terms of imprisonment in early 2017 after having pleaded guilty in December 2015 to charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise.",cybercrime,1
"This case involves the members of an organized criminal group that operated websites dedicated to the advertisement and distribution of child sexual abuse material. The website had three administrators, including Steven Chase and Michael Fluckiger, and a number of moderators, including David Lynn Browning. The website, which was hosted by a server in North Carolina, could be accessed by members only and operated on the Tor anonymity network, using elaborate file encryption to prevent the detection by law enforcement authorities. In total, more than 150,000 members authored and accessed tens of thousands of postings related to the sexual abuse of children, sometimes as young as infants or toddlers.Browning and Fluckiger were heavily involved in the day-to-day operations, which encompassed managing membership, developing and enforcing strict rules and deleting content unrelated to child sexual abuse material. Browning joined the website on 13 November 2014. Until 4 March 2015, the Browning spent over 700 hours logged in to the website, authored more than 1,000 postings, and designed the logo of the website. In 2015, a criminal complaint was filed against Browning and Fluckiger, accusing them of conspiracy to advertise child pornography contrary to 18 U.S.C. § 2251(d)(1) and (e). Fluckiger pleaded guilty on 2 December 2015 and Browning on 18 December 2015; both were sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment followed by a lifetime term of supervised release.Steven Chase was convicted of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise and related charges on 16 September 2016.

"On January 5, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against many of the claimants in this action, charging them with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering ""with estimated harm to copyright holders well in excess of $500,000,000 and reported income in excess of $175,000,000."" The claimants' alleged copyright infringement scheme, dubbed the ""Mega Conspiracy,"" used public websites to facilitate the illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted movies, software, television programs, and music. The government estimates that the alleged criminal conduct has caused billions of dollars in harm to the copyright holders.Following the indictment, the district court issued restraining orders for assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong where most of the remaining identified proceeds resided. The High Court in Hong Kong responded almost immediately by issuing a restraining order against approximately $60 million in assets, while New Zealand first arrested several of the now-claimants, released them on bail, and then several months later, in April, registered restraining orders on $15 million in assets. New Zealand also scheduled extradition hearings for August 2012, but these hearings have been continued at least eight times at the claimants' request.The New Zealand restraining orders could only remain registered for two years, after which they could be extended for up to one year. Recognizing that the restraints would run out on April 18, 2014, or if extended on April 18, 2015, the United States filed this civil forfeiture action against forty-eight assets restrained pursuant to the criminal indictment in the district court on July 29, 2014. Although restraining orders froze the assets in the lead up to this action, the New Zealand courts have routinely released funds to claimants for living and legal expenses. Some of these have been very substantial, including millions in legal fees for Kim Dotcom, and $170,000 per month for living expenses for the same claimant.Most of the claimants in this case filed their claims together on August 28, and Mona Dotcom filed a spousal claim on September 1, 2014. The claimants also filed a joint waiver of notice. The government subsequently moved to strike all the claimants' claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2466, the federal fugitive disentitlement statute. On February 27, 2015, the district court granted the motion to strike, having allowed claimants to appear and present arguments on the motion but not on the merits of the case. The government then moved for default judgment, which the district court granted on March 25, 2015, issuing forfeiture orders for the assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong.",cybercrime,0
"This case involves seven members of an organized criminal group that used the Domain Name System (DNS) Changer malware with co-conspirators to engage in a fraudulent advertisement scheme.The group posed as a legitimate Internet advertisement agency and entered into Internet advertising agreements where the defendants were paid to receive money each time a user clicked on a website link or advertisement. The defendants used rogue DNS servers and malware to fraudulently increase traffic, in turn increasing their revenue.  The malware would infect users’ systems, alter users’ DNS server settings to route activity to the rogue DNS servers, prevent anti-virus from receiving software updates, and facilitate click hijacking (i.e., where clicking on a search result redirects the user to the perpetrators’ desired site which the perpetrators receive payment for) and click fraud (i.e., fraudulently replacing advertisements on sites with desired advertisements that perpetrators receive payment for). To prevent detection from law enforcement and conceal the source of the proceeds of crime, one of the defendants was suspected of engaging in money-laundering activities by (attempting to) transport the proceeds out of the US.The defendants were charged in a 27-count-indictment in October 2011. Vladimir Tsastsin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and was sentenced to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with one year of supervision after release and was required to forfeit USD 2.5 million. Other co-conspirators also pleaded guilty and were sentenced for their crimes, including Timur Gerassimenko and Valeri Aleksejev, 4 years’ imprisonment each; Dmitri Jegorov, 3 years and 8 months’ imprisonment; Konstantin Poltev, 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment; and Anton Ivanov to time served.

"The defendant, Su Bin, a national of China, was the owner and operator of an aviation and aerospace technology business. Between 2008 and 2014, the defendant and his two co-conspirators conspired to gain unauthorized access to computers and computer networks of U.S. defense contractors to obtain sensitive data and military data (including aviation data), which was subject to export controls, and provide this data to others located outside of the U.S. for financial gain. Specifically, on multiple occasions, the defendant’s co-conspirators, who were in China, gained unauthorized access to systems, retrieved proprietary data, showed the defendant what was accessed, and received guidance from the defendant on what information to obtain from the systems. The defendant also translated the data from English to Chinese. The co-conspirators used various techniques to surreptitiously access systems and networks to evade detection. In 2015, the defendant unsuccessfully fought his extradition to the United States. After his extradition to the United States, in 2016, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. That same year, he was sentenced to 46 months’ imprisonment for his crimes.",cybercrime,1
"In 2013, and international investigation led US prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to charge 7 individuals with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The defendants ran Liberty Reserve, a digital payment facility, which allegedly laundered more than USD 6 billion in criminal proceeds. Liberty Reserve was shut down by US authorities in May 2013 as a result of the investigation. Liberty Reserve – incorporated in 2006 in Costa Rica – was a centralized digital currency service. It allowed users to deposit physical currency – Euros or US Dollars - by converting it into a digital currency pinned to the value of the physical one. Once deposited the money, users were allowed to transfer it to other users. The only personal information required to register was a name, e-mail address and birthdate. Liberty Reserve charged a small fee for each transaction.According to the investigators, Liberty Reserve was operated do facilitate money-laundering. Its structure and high degree of untraceability provided cybercriminals with a perfectly functioning tool to store and transfer the proceeds of their illegal activities. Before its shut down, the overall number of Liberty Reserve’ users worldwide exceeded on million and over 55 million transactions were conducted through its system. Such transactions included the transfer of proceeds of credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking.One of the co-founders of Liberty Reserve, Vladimir Kats, an American citizen, pleaded guilty before the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York on 31 October 2013 to conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, receiving child pornography and marriage fraud.The other co-founder, Arthur Budovsky, a citizen of Costa Rica, was arrested in Spain in May 2013 and extradited to the US in October 2014.The US Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations carried out the investigation.

"On 23 January 2013, the US District Court of the Southern District of New York unsealed three indictments against Nikita Vladimirovich Kuzmin, Deniss Calovskis and Mihai Ionut Paunescu. The defendants were charged with conspiracy in fraud and related activities in connection with computers and access devices for the creation and use of the Gozi virus. The Gozi virus is one of the most harmful computer viruses ever created. It infected at least one million computers worldwide and 40,000 in the US. It caused the theft or loss of tens of millions of dollars. The virus was undetectable by anti-virus software and was able to collect data from infected devices, including personal bank account information, usernames and passwords. The stolen information was then transmitted to servers controlled by the defendants. The defendants used such information to steal funds from victims’ bank accounts. Kuzmin created the Gozi virus in 2005. Calovskis developed a number of features, including an altered webpage of a bank that was used to steal personal information from the victims. Paunescu created a “bulletproof host”, i.e. a system preventing law enforcement authorities from detecting illegal activities. He leased servers from legitimate hosting providers and then sub-leased them to the cybercriminals. He also distributed malware, such as the “Zeus trojan” and the “SpyEye trojan”, and spam.Kuzmin was arrested in the US in November 2010 and pled guilty in May 2011. Calovskis was arrested in Latvia in November 2012. In August 2013, the Latvian government agreed to extradite Calovskis to the US. However, Calovskis appealed the decision to the Europen Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR ruled that the extradition is lawful. However, the ECHR ordered the Latvian government not to extradite Calovskis until its judgment became final.Calovskis was later extradited to the US, where he plead guilty to writing part of the virus, and was sentenced to 21 months of prison. Paunescu was arrested in Romania in December 2012 and his extradition proceeding is pending before Romanian authorities.",cybercrime,0
"Vadim Vassilenko, president of Western Express International, along with four defendants, allegedly formed and participated in a criminal enterprise. They were charged with crimes such as scheming to defraud, money laundering, grand larceny, and enterprise corruption. Western Express International operated legitimate services, such as cash checking and translation services; it also allegedly operated illegal activities such as acting as an intermediary for buying and selling stolen credit card data for a commission. Stolen credit card data was alledegly sold through Western Express International to people such as Latta, Perez, Roach, and Washington. The purpose of this sale was to use stolen credit card data to make fraudulent purchases on the internet. Additionally, Western Express provided vendors with credit by using digital currencies like Egold and Webmoney, which were unregulated. This allowed vendors to engage in transactions without disclosing their identities.  The appellants were charged with cybercrimes, such as scheming to defraud, money laundering, grand larceny, and enterprise corruption, although the present appeal dealt with the charge of enterprise corruption. They allegedly used the business entity Western Express International to avoid detection and to systematically traffic stolen credit card data and to engage in money laundering. Computers at Western Express International and Vassilenko’s residences included evidence of money orders, forged credit cards, and defendants’ email, which contained information such as illegally obtained credit card numbers. The prosecution sought to establish that a criminal enterprise existed in order to carry out these activities, which occurred alongside Western Express International’s legitimate business activities. Hackers obtained credit card information that was then used to make counterfeit credit cards or to purchase things online fraudulently.Vassilenko, president of Western Express International, allegedly sought to use the business as a business with legitimate activities in order to allow people to carry out their illegal activities without detection.",cybercrime,0

"The case involves illegal bulking email obscene advertising in the US. The defendants started their business in 2003. At the beginning, they operated through a US corporation. Later on, they decided to run their operations from a Mauritian company – using servers located in the Netherlands – in order to avoid compliance with the email communications bill passed in the US in 2003, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (hereinafter, the “CAN-SPAM Act”). The defendants sent email advertisements, including pornographic content. If the recipients clicked on the links contained in the email and subsequently paid a fee, the defendants earned a commission.The defendants used fictitious information in their bulk emails and registration of their domain names. They placed non-existing email addresses in the “From” field in the headers of their emails. They provided false information in the “Contact person” and “Phone number” fields of their domains’ registration.On 25 June 2007, the defendants were convicted on 8 counts from the District Court of Arizona for conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1037(a)(3) through fraud in connection with electronic mail (Count 1), violation of § 1037(a)(3) and (a)(4) through such fraud (Counts 2 and 3), interstate transportation of obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1462 (Counts 4 and 5), interstate transportation of obscene materials for sale in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1465 (Counts 6 and 7); conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (Count 8), and failure to meet record keeping requirements in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2257 (Count 9).The first three counts regard the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” introduced by the CAN-SPAM Act. The defendants were convicted of materially falsifying  header information in multiple commercial electronic mail messages and intentionally initiating the transmission of such messages [§ 1037(a)(3)] and registering, using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant, for five or more electronic mail accounts or online user accounts or two or more domain names, and intentionally initiating the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from any combination of such accounts or domain names [§ 1037(a)(4)].The defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that (i) the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of obscene expression pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1462 and 1465; (ii) the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” (18 U.S.C. § 1037) was unconstitutional as it was overly vague; (iii) counts 1-3 were incorrectly labelled as felonies; (iv) the count of conspiracy money laundering is invalid if the preceding appeals are successful since an unlawful activity is a pre-requisite for the money laundering offence; (v) the application of a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement to one of the defendants’ sentence was error.The defendants’ claim that 18 U.S.C. § 1037 was unconstitutional is based on the vagueness doctrine, according to which  “Vague statutes are invalidated for three reasons”: (1) to avoid punishing people for behaviour that they could not have known was illegal; (2) to avoid subjective enforcement of laws based on `arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement' by government officers; and (3) to avoid any chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms."" The defendants argued that the terms ""impair,"" ""altered,"" and ""concealed."" used to describe the material falsification were vague. The court rejected the argument.  The court affirmed the defendants’ convictions and sentences and recognized that there was a clerical error with regard to counts 1-3 (the CAN-SPAM Act offences) and remanded.",cybercrime,0
